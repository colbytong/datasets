At least once a week. I order the same thing each time : tofu sweet and sour no rice 4 spicy--
It's hit or miss. They sometimes give me chicken, there are times it only has 2 tomatoes a few carrots and a piece of celery as the vegetable, and the whole month of December every time I ordered lunch they'd give me / charge me for dinner sizes-- and I just had to accept it.
Can't stress enough that I continue to order from here because when it's good, it's so good!
I gave it a 3/5 bc 3/5 times I get my order exactly how I placed it.","Ashton S.","Horrible service. Was served meat after explicitly saying I do not eat meat.
I came in at lunch when it was dead with about four other patrons in the restaurant. I ordered yellow curry with brown rice no chicken add shrimp. He asked me, ""ok chicken and shrimp curry?"" I clearly clarified, ""No. Absolutely no chicken. I do not eat chicken or meat. Yellow curry, brown rice, shrimp only."" My order came out with white rice and to my dismay, chicken which I discovered after I began eating.
Multiple people came in, got seated, waited then got up and left because no one would serve them. The workers could care less. I could understand if they were busy but it almost seemed as if they were hiding in the back because they did not know what they were doing. Me and another woman couldn't get anyone to help us pay our bill. We asked multiple times, went to the back, front and kitchen and were both late to work because they would not help us and had no access to change. There are so many amazing food places in Capitol Hill that will not only get your order correct but put in an effort to give great customer service. Such a bummer.","Daniel K.","Summary: good service, good prices, quick service
We didn't experience the bad service mentioned in a lot of these other reviews. We arrived at 7 on a Wednesday and were seated immediately. After the server took our order, it took around 15 mins to come out. Everything was very no-nonsense, which was fine.
I ordered the panang curry lvl2 spicy, though it didn't taste very spicy at all. The sauce was a little watery but overall still quite tasty. I'm generally not a big fan of basil, but it's usually fine because there isn't much. At jai thai there was much more basil (prob most I've seen in a thai place) but it didn't really negatively affect the taste and I just picked the leaves out. Another in the group ordered the pad thai, which he did not enjoy I think. The noodles looked a little mushy and he left over half unfinished.","Ali A.","By far the worst place to eat food in seattle. Don't believe me? give it a shot? Terrible food, they lost two of our cards and on top of that the comedians are awesome, and you want to support them but not in such a shitty resturant, just get a simple drink laugh with the comedianns and bounce!","Hai D.","I'm sorry for the negative review but they forgot to add chicken to my takeout order. The order was incorrect when inputting them into the ordering system which should've been a red flag. I also asked for spiciness which wasn't right either.
So that was annoying. Just a heads up for everyone to check your orders.","Anum I.","Walked in last night for some quick bites and stayed in for much longer, thanks to Seattle's unpredictable weather. We ordered a Tom Yum soup, Country style Phud Thai and Mongolian Beef. The food was way too sweet for taste. Even the Tom Yum soup was sweet, which got my tastebuds were super confused.
It was a Friday night and to my surprise there was only one waitress. She was sweet, but swamped, i don't blame her. Not sure if I'd return...","Lledo E.","I don't know about the service, because we ordered to go. But, worst pad thai I have ever tried. They stay open until later than most of the other restaurants though.","Brian H.","Wow Anna wow and wow
Best of Thai noodler ever
Excellent service. Nice house wine. Big portion. Best prices. Well come K back her for sure","M F.","Jai Thai restaurant located at 235 Broadway Ave East, Seattle 98102 was closed by a Public Health food inspector on December 12, 2019 at 2:00 pm due to the following food safety violations:
Handwash stations not maintained
Improper cooling and cold holding of foods
Lack of facility sanitation and maintenance","Michael J.","Went there tonight to get an order to go because google said they were open until 11pm it's now 1015. There was a guy and girl working the counter and they rudely said we are closed as soon as my friend walked in. Pissed. Don't go here","John P.","What a dump! Go somewhere else! I literally called 15 minutes before going in for my pickup order. Got there and waiting around for like 10 minutes. Being ignored. Only to be told that they never got my order. People are rude and the only reason I called here in the first place is cause they were the only Thai place open. Go to Bites of Bangkok! They are awesome. The service here is terrible. And from past experience the food is a little less than so so.","Jordan C.","Just down the street from Dicks is this lil Thai restaurant that keeps its window open late night. The food is cheap, quick, and good. Never fines in but the accessibility is something unique in Seattle. It's definitely the perfect munchy meal!","Davide S.","Disgusting customer service!
I ordered a ""2-star"" pineapple fried rice for pick up and the restaurant made the order incorrectly; the ticket on the to-go bag actually read, ""4-star"". I generally never go out of my way to send food back at restaurants but the food was inedible due to how spicy it was. So, I called and informed them of the mistake, to which she clearly said that if I returned the uneaten meal, she would remake my order and refund my money. Sadly, she did neither of these but lied to me and disrespected me instead.
I returned to the restaurant and also returned the uneaten food as instructed. She took the food to the back and after a few minutes the female employee came out and gave me the ""new order"" of fried rice. I inspected the container and to my discovery, realized she just buried the old order with more steamed rice. I believe she tried to mix it up in attempts to dilute the spice but I could blatantly see that the rice on top was white and the rice below it was still smothered in chili flakes. I took a taste test to verify and it was still incredibly spicy. Keep in mind she was standing next to me the whole time. I called her out and told her that the order was not fresh and still spicy. She said I was wrong and that if I wanted a new order I had to pay. (Please understand that the initial situation was the restaurant getting my order wrong.)
In attempts to just get out of there, I asked if she could refund my order like she stated on the phone. Of course, she said that I could not be refunded and keep the food. quote: ""No, if you want a refund you have to give me the rice. You can't have both. If you want I'll give you a refund and you can go around the corner and eat at McDonald's.""
....dead
Simple economics consists of a trade of goods and services for money. I had an agreement with Jai Thai to exchange money for food but the food I was given was not what I had asked for. Because of this we both made a verbal agreement to alleviate the matter by me exchanging the incorrect order for a correct one and to also be refunded my money. I didn't receive a refund nor did I receive the correct order, instead I was lied to and disrespected. Why would you lie and make me go back if you were not going to return my food? Terrible business.","Thomas W.","I have only ever used the window to order but if I was to just rate the food I would def give it a 5/5. The other Thai is saucy and tasty and they give very generous portions for 5$. The Thai tea is 3 dollars and not too bad but I would definitely recommend trying their food at least once!","Nick W.","We came here with a friend because it was within walking distance of his work. We got the fresh spring rolls, Tom kha soup, and should've stopped there. They were fresh and actually some of the better dishes I've had. The spring rolls had good flavor and came with a nice soy hoisin sauce! The Tom kha had a nice acidity and was delightfully sweet. However, then the fun ended. We got the Panang curry, pineapple curry, and ""phad see lew..."" well the curries tasted exactly the same except you added a can of pineapple pieces to one of them. I wouldn't be upset if the curry base was tasty. But it had only one note and was overly sweet. The noodles were fine, a little bland and underwhelming. Not worth returning for. I wouldn't come back for the price or food. However, I would like to end on a good note by saying the service was pleasant and attentive.","Jessy R.","This has happened to me twice now! First time: I call and the line is busy, I tried like five times and gave up.
Today I called and was put on hold for five minutes and then the line went dead and I tried to call back and the line was busy. I walked there and she said it was because it was busy but there was one table when I walked in?
Around 5:30 July 5","Susan B.","It's not worth it, don't order from here! There are way better places for as good a deal or better.
I ordered the drunken noodles, crab delight appetizer, and black rice pudding dessert. Crab appetizer was crunchy but the filling had no flavor and a nauseating texture. Noodles were ok, but the meat in them (I got beef and chicken) was dry, tough, and flavorless like old leather. Maybe getting the noodles with only vegetables would be ok, but still not great as the noodles and sauce were very mediocre. The pudding was excessively, sickeningly sweet.
Overall a waste of money, I ate barely a quarter of each item and threw the rest away. 2 stars only because the noodles (without the meat) were not terrible, and if I had ordered them that way, I might have somewhat enjoyed them.","Terry C.","Came in for some take out but stood by the bar and had a drink while I waited only to discover live stand up! Never knew they had that, so needless to say the time spent waiting was very entertaining. And Brad the bartender was very nice and accommodating","Victoria H.","Gosh, I don't even know what to say here. I went to Jai Thai once, and it was a one and done for me.
The food was AMAZING, but the service was HORRENDOUS. The only reason I am giving the place two stars is because of the food. The moment we sat down in the restaurant, we were literally ignored and they did not even acknowledge us. I had to asked to be served. Also, the serving staff did not come and check on us at all. In order to get a refill on my drink, I had to literally get up away from my table and ask the server to please refill my soda. The service was COMICALLY horrible. They placed an order that no one in the entire restaurant or to-go had ordered. The server said ""I must have placed that order on accident."" She was running around like a chicken with her head cut off, and all I could do was laugh at the ridiculousness and incompetence that was happening right before my eyes. A process from sit down to exit that in a decent restaurant, takes an hour, took us over two just to eat and get out at Jai Thai, and there was hardly anyone there!
I had the fried rice with beef and it was delicious. HOWEVER, the spring rolls were another story. They were so greasy, it tasted like I was eating a can of Crisco, literally. It was awful.
Overall, customer service is HORRIBLE, and again I say HORRIBLE. However, the food is actually good Thai food, in my opinion.
The choice is yours and your gamble if you choose to eat at Jai Thai.","Suppakorn W.","Food is too sweet. I've ordered multiple things from this restaurant from Panang curry to Tom Yum soup to Tom Kha soup. Everything is too sweet. In addition, the restaurant messed up my Grubhub order, I ordered Phad Prik King and they delivered me Phad Prik. Two completely different things, yet they argued that I ordered it wrong. I really wanted to like this place because it opens late and they deliver, but I couldn't. I won't be returning."

My work crew like to go here for birthday lunches. I started this new thing... order the same thing at the various thai places... I know... But it has been illuminating. This place so far has the best Chicken Saute and Fresh Rolls on the Ave. Granted it's the third spot. Stay tuned for more on that.
This placed doesn't look like much from the street. It has an ""Excellent"" food safety rating, and the folks are always pleasant and helpful. The food is consistently good and it typically only takes about 5 minutes to get my take away orders. When eating in, service is always prompt and courteous. The food is well seasoned, but definitely played down on the spice. This is a good choice when you're on the ave and craving some Thai. They have space for that team meeting or will have you in and out for take away.","Evie L.","INTERIOR: 4/5
Pretty spacious inside. Much bigger than it looks from outside. Looked pretty clean. Multiple TVs inside.
WAIT: 2/5
We were a group of two and came around noon on a weekday. My friend and I were seated pretty quickly. Once we made our order, however, the wait for our food was pretty long, especially considering the amount of people in the restaurant, which wasn't that many.
FOOD: 2/5
I ordered the pad see ew. Would not recommend. It came out liquidy and too saucy. Still edible, but you'll get much better at the other Thai places nearby. It was a good amount though. Definitely had enough for another meal, but did I want to bring it home to eat later? No, not really. Did I anyways? Yes. Did I eat it? No.
SERVICE: 4/5
Staff were kind and attentive.
OVERALL: 2/5
Would not recommend. You'll get better Thai food pretty much anywhere else on the Ave.","Paulina H.","I ordered on DoorDash, I thought I got the one from Fremont, but apparently it's the one in U district! I ordered Phad Thai with Tofu with medium spicy and crab delight! I'm happy they gave me rice in it, yay more food! But they made it too salty and it's not spicy at all, like I couldn't taste any spice! Crab delight is okay, but it's too greasy but it's crispy! Overall, I don't think I have a good experience of the food!
Food: 4/10","Harley P.","Extremely salty dishes. Wow, just sooooo salty. I thought it's chef's mistake but after 2 visits, it was confirmed. The chef loves to over salt everything. It's not a mistake. I don't know how my kidneys are gonna become if I eat here once a week....","Sabrina M.","Went here for lunch today. The Thai fried rice was good, but I found a bug in my to-go order of spring rolls :(
I wish I had opened it sooner, I would have gone back to complain","Lawrence L.","Good Thai. They have great lunch combos so you can mix and match with some Pad Thai if you're into the variety. Probably wouldn't get the crispy garlic chicken or whatever that specialty dish was in the picture if it weren't for the last few bites! Man that dish's sauce is so good, but they barely put any on on ours. It's mainly with the idea that they typically put more sauce that I'm giving this 4 star review, otherwise it'd probably be more like a 3. Fix that please! Mango sticky rice did not disappoint. Happy with the polite service. Pretty great place among the many on the Ave.","Kalpana R.","I haven't visited this new location of Jai Thai in UD, but I got food delivered via Postmates.
The combo meals here are great value for money. Each combo comes with veg pad Thai and white rice. I ordered no 10 which was a side of yellow curry. The quantity is great and it can make for 1.5 or 2 meals. While the pad Thai didn't have a side of lemon nor much veggies, the yellow curry came with decent amount of chicken. However the taste wasn't great. The pad Thai was ok tasting, definitely not ketchup based, but not mind blowing either. The yellow curry had good amount of ingredients but felt watered down. Both the dishes were very sweet also and even though I had ordered medium spicy, were very bland.
I'll give them a try again to try their other noodles, stir fries and fried rices, since I wasn't impressed with the curry. Hopefully they can turn down the sugar quotient and add some more spice to the dishes.","Kristine M.","What a great Thai restaurant to bring your family or large groups of friends! The food portions are huge and everything we ordered was so delicious / fairly priced. We ordered curry, pad kee mao, papaya salad.. and a few other entrees and we were very pleased with everything. The service was on point, and the environment is great for conversation.","Paul S.","Don't Play The Fool
I just paid $17 out the door for a plate of noodles and rice with a little curry on the side. The total paid included a $2 premium for prawns of which there were 3 medium small ones.
Here's a news flash from someone who's been in the U District for 8 years. When your clients are mostly students, you must offer real value consistently and not ever be stingy. Restaurants that don't ""get"" this don't last on our Ave. These clowns won't either.","Jurarut C.","We made a bad choice coming in here. Came in and the staff was disgusting in thai, how a table had just walked out without paying.
We were seated at a table that was not clean. Then the waitress walked away and did not return with our menus or waters. When she returned she asked what we wanted to order. Then she finally realized that she had forgotten our menus. Then we asked if our table could be wiped down again because it was so sticky.
I ordered a dish for my daughter that came with sticky rice. She came back after put in our order to see if it was ok to sub the sticky rice with jasmin rice. I told her that was fine. She was not 4eally aware of what is available. The kitchen probably did not want to make the sticky rice since it takes so long.
I watched as she sat another large party where their table was not clean either. Then usually menus are either presented to the diners in hand or ibfront of them. She just handed a stack of menus to one person to hand out to everyone.
Finally one of our food items came after about 15 minutes (not bad) wich was the pork skewers. The skewers were warm rather than hot.
I was just not impressed with service and food was was too salty.","Jacob H.","I long for a Thai restaurant where ""spicy"" actually means spicy. I've had spicier spaghetti noodles.","Terran W.","Came here for lunch. Got a combo. Food was a solid 2 star. No way it was 4 star spicy, noodles over done, sauce gnarl.
Service was 4 star. Server could really work anywhere they like, but here they were.","Ekarat K.","Good Thai food and very enjoy this service Nice and clean inside my new favorite spot on the ave !","MB E.","The worst Thai food I have ever had. My food was cold in the middle. Very disappointing. No flavor and the vegetables were barely cooked.","Kyler H.","This was a phenomenal experience! My friend and I went in for mango sticky rice dessert and were blown away. The entire staff was friendly and went above and beyond for us. After ordering the mango sticky rice, we saw the cooks working in the open format kitchen as we sat at the adjoining bar. They kept cutting open mangos and throwing them away which was curious to us. In the end, they said that all the mangos they had were either too ripe when they cut them open or not ripe enough to try to prepare. To compensate, a cook left the restaurant, went to a market up the street, and purchased fresh ripe mangoes for our dish. It was incredibly nice of them and exhibited such a high level of service and care for their customers. On top of the welcoming staff and amazing service, the sticky rice itself was delicious! Not too sweet and beautifully complemented by the fresh ripe mango. We will definitely be returning!","Casey M.","I ordered via Postmates so I can't speak to the service, but my food was really bland. I was disappointed I ordered from this place.","Vivian C.","This is my new FAVORITE Thai place on the Ave!!! The restaurant is clean, spacious, and well decorated (as are their bathrooms). Every time I come here, even to pick up online orders, the staff are incredibly friendly and polite! They have big portions that are delicious and affordable! I love getting the lunch combos which they serve all-day and are only $11.50! I love getting the pad thai and panang curry combo, and my boyfriend loves the pad thai and orange chicken combo. I usually have leftovers I can eat the next day. Their Thai iced teas are very good too and only $2.50. Another great perk is they have a stamp card which I believe is buy 10 meals get 1 free. I am such a huge fan of this new Thai restaurant and have been telling all my friends to try it. Their flavors and spices are much better compared to other Thai restaurants on the Ave. I highly recommend Jai Thai - you'll become a loyal customer soon too!","Sami J.","I had a friend recommend this place for a good Thai spot while I was in town visiting.... my friend is wrong. Good?!? This place is phenomenal, the atmosphere, the service and of course the food is just on another level! I live in Houston, Texas and there is no shortage of diverse high end food, our Asian restaurants compete with NYC and LA in this regard. However, I have to say I was shocked by the quality and presentation of the food! Next time I'm in the area I will definitely be making a stop here!!","Kayla G.","This place should seriously have a much higher rating! I've been in twice now and the food and service is consistently great! I came here for lunch and ordered their combo both times with pad Thai and panang curry (which is awesome that they offer to begin with because it's a perfect portion size for one person, you get 2 dishes, and it's very affordable) plus a Thai iced tea. The food is delicious and comes out super quick! I sat by the ""bar"" where you can watch them cook/prepare the food which is cool. Honestly though, the best part is the staff. There's a young woman that is usually holding down the fort at lunch time and she's the BEST! She is so sweet and friendly. She's attentive and makes sure your food and bill comes out quick, which is especially appreciated at lunch. She also gave me a free side of rice when I got the rest of my food to go. The cook staff is also very friendly (I could talk to them since the bar seating is right next to the kitchen). When she got busy, they filled in the gap to see how they could help. I have nothing bad to say about this place and it will continue to be a regular lunch spot for me!","Autumn B.","I'm surprised of the remodel from the old Thai restaurant. It looks much larger inside and it looks great. I tried to crab rangoons (or however you spell it), pad thai, pad kra pow, and tom yum. It was all very flavorful and the portions are big."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Kevin M.","An amazing, lovely restaurant with a beautiful view on the inside and out.
Came here for a special occasion with my S.O. Started with a half bottle of local wine and their meat and cheese board. The meats varied from fatty, to hard, to spicy, to earthy. The cheeses were a medium and a soft cheese. Sides of spicy mustard and slightly sweet jam. This was a delicious board that we almost finished in its entirety.
For dinner I had the rigatoni with meatballs. And she had the lasagna. Mmmm the rigatoni was cooked perfectly, with just enough of a bite. The sauce was bright and fresh, if not a bit sour. I would personally add a bit of sugar to offset, but it was delicious nonetheless.
I had a few bites of the lasagna, I have tasted few lasagnas that come close. The spinach gave the pasta an elegant green hue, and their cheese was melted to a perfect cream consistency. The layer of pesto really gave this dish the richness that made it so special. Highly recommend the lasagna.
Finally, we finished off with espresso and their cheesecake. The cheesecake was hazelnut flavored and was very good. The hazelnut creme was just sweet enough. If you are a fan of hazelnut you will like this. Otherwise I could have done with a different flavor cheesecake.
Overall the food was fantastic. And the location and decor made dinner that much more special. I couldn't imagine a cozier restaurant. Dinner felt intimate. And the service was good. I will be back!","Ryan J.","The Pink Door is as amazing as everyone else claims it to be! From the unseemly entrance to the beautiful view and decor, this place has earned its prestige as one of the best Italian restaurants around.
With a place that is so well known in Seattle, they are quite humble with their entrance. Walking thru a not so busy alley, if you see a Pink Door you've arrived at the right place. Upon entry, you can see the cozy intimate decor. And in the back they have a fantastic view of Pike's Place waterfront.
They have a great selection of items on their menu that are both exquisite and delicious. My GF and I ordered the Pink Door Lasagna, Special squid ink pasta with mussels and shrimp, Arancini and Tuscan Fries to share. The TUSCAN FRIES WERE AMAZING! They fry it with sage, rosemary, and garlic which gives it a subtle yet addicting flavor. The Arancini was quite good, but I was truly impressed by the Lasagna. Although it comes in a small dish, this is really all you need. Layers of spinach pasta packed with rich bechamel sauce and pesto and marinara was to die for. This is certainly one of those dishes you eat slowly to just savor all of the flavors.
This is definitely a must try for those who love Italian food or just want to spend a romantic night out with someone special. Just make sure to reserve a table early in advance.","Daisy V.","Known for its pink door entrance, The Pink Door was something I was excited to try in Seattle.
Wow, the view and ambiance were amazing here. I recommend reserving an outdoor table if you can! The view is so nice and there's something about eating outside here during the day that makes you feel good.
The lasagna was delicious. I kept raving about it while eating! The service was great. The Pink Door is a charming place to stop by for lunch or dinner if in Seattle.","Tamara D.","We've been looking forward to coming here for weeks. I'm so glad we made reservations because when we got there 5 mins before opening, there was already a group of people waiting. By the time we were seated, the place was almost filled up.
I'd remarked on our reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary (15 years!!) and when we sat down the server brought out complimentary glasses of Prosecco for toasting. What a special touch!
We ordered several things I can't pronounce but this has to be one of the top tasting meals I've had. I always tell everyone about Mesa Grill in Vegas as the place I've had my best meal ever but this definitely rivals it. Such friendly staff, such great service, we will be back every time we are in town for sure.","Sebastian T.","This place not only has a great rep, but it can also back it up! I've come here a few times and I've always had great experiences. It is a pretty big space with lots of interesting features: aerial shows in the main dining room, live music, an amazing patio and inner section of the restaurant with gorgeous views of the water. This spot is really popular so I'd highly recommend reservations or you're easily looking at a 60 min+ wait.
While entrees here can cost $20-30 each, its nice to see that it's not fine dining to the extent where its tiny portions, but you get a nice hefty plate with great preparation. While the food I've had is good, it wasn't shockingly amazing. A solid 4/5 but you're really coming here for the overall ambience. I'd highly recommend coming here at least once to check it out! This place also is an amazing date spot!","Maggie S.","Probably my favorite restaurant in Seattle...Pink Door never disappoints. I really appreciate the consistency of the quality of food and service! The perfect restaurant for casual dining with family or friends, and a romantic date night!
Winter Risotto | Must. Order. Creamy butternut squash risotto that warms up your entire heart...
Linguine Alle Vongole | The signature dish of pink door! This pasta dish never goes wrong; the white wine broth really elevates and balances out the flavor of the clam. Love this simple yet delicate dish!
Cioppino | Never a big fan of tomato broths but this one's different. The amount of seafood is worth the price and the tomato broth is light and smooth, so you won't get tired of it!
Northwest Fish of the Day | Not a must order, but good quality fish! The salmon is seared to perfection with a crispy layer of fatty skin and tender meat on the inside!
Tuscan Fries with Fried Herbs | The aioli is so tasty that we can't stop snacking on these fries!! Wish the flavors of the herbs are stronger...","Subail S.","Love this restaurant, little bit pricey, but never disappoints.
You definitely need to reserve table if you want to sit in the main dining. My advice will be a week before to be on the safer side.
Went for dinner on our first anniversary. Didn't reserve the table early, so got the slot at 10:15 pm. :( but got the table with the best view.
Food is always good. They have one of the best oysters in the city. So highly recommended. Other foods are also good.
Only sad thing is they don't have lot of optIons for the people who are allergic to red meat and shrimp. So that was a bummer for my wife.
But still would like to go back again.","Cindy C.","It's hard to get a reservation for this place as it gets booked months and months in advance. Imagine my surprise and happiness when we snatched up an available lunch time that worked for a party of 2! We were also visiting from out of town, so really happy that it all worked out.
You can also be on standby and wait for a table, but it can be a long wait.
FOOD
We ordered the rabbit ragu pasta and cioppino soup.
The rabbit ragu pasta was better than I expected. The meat was tender, and the pasta had texture.
Cioppino soup was delicious! Exceeded my expectations a lot. There were plentiful pieces of seafood. I would recommend dipping the complimentary bread with the soup. I was full after the dish.
SERVICE
The servers were very attentive with refilling our water.

It's in the heart of pike place where post ally is. If you are driving, there are parking available nearby.","Elizabeth L.","One of our go-to date spots, love Pink Door! Favorite seats are at the bar - fun bartenders, ample space to enjoy lovely live music and jazz while indulging in delicious house pastas.
Linguine Alle Vongole - obsessed with this dish. Baby clams in shell, pancetta, garlic, chilis in a light white wine sauce. Clams for days, linguine perfectly al dente.
Lasagna - an interesting house version with super thin sheets of spinach pasta, layered with bechamel and pesto, topped with marinara - flavorful artistry, no dull, heavy lasagna here.
Crab risotto - chockfull of crab! A beautiful risotto, albeit not as interesting as the linguine or lasagna
Service is friendly and professional - have always enjoyed excellent service at the bar. Reservations are recommended as waits can be formidable during peak hours, but if you come by on a whim, just put your name down and enjoy a drink at Radiator Whiskey, Rachel's Ginger Beer or any of the fun bars nearby!","Dean C.","1/12/20
Not that I paid particular attention, but from memory it seemed like Pink Door has been all over my Yelp feed since forever--I think every foodie that lives in Seattle, or has been to Seattle, has Yelped this place. So, I had to...
But for those that aren't from Seattle, or I guess I should say for those from California cause I heard other states have similar, but it appears many restaurants, even the really popular ones are REALLY REALLY REALLY hard to find. Like I tried to get to this popular bar the next day and it was on the 2nd or 3rd floor with NO SIGNS outside the building. Really no way to know how to get there without being told...
and yeah, so Pink Door is one of those. First, it's in an alley. Luckily the GPS does hint at that. BUT, I spent the longest time trying to find the entrance cause there's NO SIGN outside, and THERE IS NO PINK DOOR (unless I'm color blind?) The door IS NOT PINK. So, if you see this plain door but hear some trance or other form of electronica, this is probably the place, so you can open the door.
Yeah, so trance... when I walked in, there was a girl hanging from the ceiling on a rope, dancing in the air like a ballerina, accompanied by some trance. So, it's a mostly-traditional Italian restaurant food-wise, with an extremely modern vibe. Interesting.
Food though is above average but not particularly great...
1. Pink Door Mocktail (Non-Alcoholic) $8 ""bartenders seasonal creation"": Don't. Unless you wanna pay $8 for a lemonade. Mocktail my ass. 1/10
2. Cup of Riobolita $10 ""the traditional Tuscan vegetable & bread soup w/ cannellini beans and parmigiano reggiano, a wooden spoon should be able to stand up in the pot"": I did try to stand a spoon in it... and waddya know, it fell but got pretty close. I think if it were a normal sized spoon it might have done it! Think of this soup as a vegetable stew, with just a little but of French onion topping. As for the ""bread soup"" part, I'm not sure where the bread went--maybe as a thickener? Anyway, it was okay, but not particularly special. 6/10
3. Cioppino Pink Door $27 ""prawns, rock fish, mussels, clams and clamari in a spicy tomato and white wine broth"": Compared to others I've had, the soup here is pretty thin and super peppery, though I did enjoy the abundant seafood flavor. It's also served piping hot, which was nice compared to other restaurants. The mussels were tiny, but cooked absolutely perfectly with super plump flesh. The fish was just okay--not dry but definitely not moist. Shrimp was good and still crunchy, but not really what I'd expect of ""prawns""--they're just the same shelled, curled shrimp you see in standard Chinese food. Strangely, there was absolutely no carbs served??? No toast, no nothing. Weird huh? 6/10
4. Flourless Chocolate Cake $11 ""port wine, poached seckel pear, pomegranate port sauce"": Well, this is NOT a cake--but the waiter did warn me, so I guess I can't fault them too much for the false advertising. It's basically a chocolate bar of gaunache (fancy word for semi-soft chocolate) with a braised pear on top. I did like the tart sauce that was packed with berries, but otherwise there wasn't much to this dessert. But I suppose, if you're a true chocolate lover it might float your boat. 6/10
I am really tempted to give them brownie points for just being really cool, but honestly I wouldn't go back cause the food wasn't worth a second visit and I'm sure there are less fancy but better tasting Italian restaurants in Seattle, so...
(but I do think you should come here once sooner or later just to experience how weird and modern a ""traditional"" Italian restaurant can be while still being ""cool"" and without being annoying.)
Oooooooooooooooooh f it.... I guess it's worth a special visit just cuz... (but seriously, the food is just a 3)
4/5
#seattle #bymyself #traditionalitalian #italiancuisine #italianfood #moderndecor","Jessica M.","Came here for my birthday and I had the perfect experience. They had no more available reservations but accept walk-ins. We read from previous yelp reviews to expect a wait so we stopped by a little earlier to put our name and number down. We were told a 45 minute wait and our table was ready for us by the time we made our way back.
For starters, we ordered the Crostini Ai Funghi (mushroom on grilled toast). The mushrooms were flavorful and the toast was crispy! I love Linguine alle Vongole so this was a must. Definitely the highlight of the meal. Clams were fresh and the linguine was cooked to perfection.
Although the place was packed with people, our attentive server was able to bring out our meals quickly. This is a great restaurant for date night or hanging out with friends. Highly recommend - just try to make reservations beforehand.","Jennifer K.","This was probably one of my top favorite dining experiences in all of my travels. My husband's friend had mentioned this place, otherwise we would've had no idea and weren't planning on eating here. It's actually pretty hidden and you definitely need reservations, which I managed to get pretty last minute (visiting off season in January). The interior is very unique, it has an art deco/1920's vibe which I love. They actually have live trapeze artists on weekends, they perform above you while you eat. Unfortunately we missed that being a weeknight, but it was still a very entertaining evening. They had live jazz performers, and the atmosphere is just so lively. It has a beautiful view of the water if you're lucky to sit in the back area.
The food was delicious! We had Lasagne with besciamella, pesto, & marinara *new york steak with twice baked potatoes *caesar salad with crab and *maple creme brulee.","Katie Y.","God, I just love this place. The first time I came here was for my 16th birthday (quite a few years ago.. yikes), and the last time I came here was over 10 years later. It's just as good, if not better, than I remember it.
We came here right when it opened on a weekend, put our name in and got seated maybe 30-45m later. I'd recommend making reservations in advance if you can. The restaurant is a little hard to find the first time, walk down Post Alley and literally look for an unmarked pink door. Inside, it's surprisingly big with high ceilings as you walk down and start to realize how eclectic and funky it is inside.
The hype is so real about this place. We ordered charcuterie (both meat and cheese boards) and both were fantastic. The pastas did not disappoint, the risotto basically tastes like butter.. but in pasta form, if you're into that (butter, that is). Honestly, everything I've ever tasted here has been nothing short of amazing. If this place weren't so hard to get to (in an alley of Pike Place), hard to find parking, and hard to get reservations/a table, I probably wouldn't wait so many years between visits.","Douglas R.","The Pink Door is straight fire.
Background: In Seattle for a weekend getaway with my wife this place came on my radar. We had wanted to eat here on previous trips but didn't make it. I knew this place must be the real deal because we couldn't even get a reservation for the Sunday of MLK weekend. Surrounding days only had reservations for like 9 oclock or later. Reminds me of The House of Prime Rib in San Francisco in terms of difficulty of getting a reservation.
The Wait with No reservations: We showed up at 8 and were seated by 9:15 at a great table in the lounge. While we were waiting we scored a couple of seats at the bar and had drinks. Time went by fast as we enjoyed our drinks. Bartenders were super friendly and accommodating. My wife can't have gluten and they were awesome about making her a lemon drop with a grain free vodka.
Ambiance: One of the coolest most unique places I've ever been. Great live entertainment, dim lighting perfect for a date night.
What we ordered: Drink wise we went with a lemon drop and an old fashioned (2). Great drinks.
Winter Risotto: My wife ordered this and really enjoyed it. It comes gluten free too which she was super excited about.
Lasagna: Man this was a straight smoke show. Damn it was delicious. Mind blown.
Mixed Greens: Solid standard with a vinaigrette dressing.
Service:Great all the way around.
Bread:Complimentary bread before the meal. So nice that they had gluten free bread for us.
Prices: I felt like they were super reasonable for the quality of food and experience you get here.
Final Thoughts: Such a great night out. Thanks Pink Door. If you can't get a reservation don't let that stop you. Show up about an hour before you would have made your reservation time and just grab a bar stool. Have a drink and take it all in.","Lisa E.","There is a reason The Pink Door has so many great reviews, it is pretty fabulous. Is it a bit touristy and right near the fish market? Yes...but it is not just a cliche tourist joint. The Pink Door has great food and atmosphere! I have never had a bad thing here.
If you like oysters, get their oysters. They are delicious, and I love their peppery vinaigrette mixture that comes with it and the presentation is lovely.
I have had their seafood specials, pasta specials and just salads here and have never been disappointed. My customer once had a risotto here that she said was a bit bland, but other than that I cannot think of any complaints.
The bar makes fabulous drinks, and they have a great variety of unique liquors. The entertainment is what I believe the Pink Door is known for, and the hostesses do a great job trying to accommodate all patrons trying to see the stage. The atmosphere is grand and a bit over the top as you would expect. In general this is great for a cozy date, or even a lively business dinner. All clients and colleagues I have brought to the Pink Door have not been disappointed.","Tazeen L.","Great spot with a fun atmosphere, great views, occasional music and good food... came in without a reservation and had a 1.5 hr wait for a table for 3 on a Saturday night. Service was friendly and helpful, ended up sharing a few things:
-lasagna- recommended by waiter and definitely the winner - great balance of ingredients, well seasoned, everything you want out of cheesy comforting plate of pasta
- cioppino- seafood was fresh & tender, could have had more variety (mainly mussels and shrimp). Broth was light, could have used more seasoning
- pappardelle- noodles were al dente, ragu was good
Overall good spot if you can get a reservation...","Ce O.","Came for our last supper in Seattle. We had Spiced Wine and The Butler to drink. To eat, I had the pappardelle bolognese. My partner had the lasagna. Both dishes were delicious but we could have used several more bites of each. I imagine that they don't make the main entrees larger so that you'll buy dessert. However, we don't eat sweets so we left feeling unfulfilled. The entertainment was a delightful added bonus, though. To get the full enjoyment of the experience, I'd recommend requesting cornered seating, so that half the party's backs aren't to the performer. Otherwise, give it try!","Stephen C.","Arguably the most famous Italian restaurant in Seattle. After visiting I can understand why it sometimes can take months to get a reservation at this establishment. The Italian cuisine is on point and the service is impeccable. The restaurant seating is split between a lounge type of seating and a main dining room. We we were unable to get seating within the main dining room and sat in the lounge seating - personally we enjoyed it very much and it was very fitting for lunch. I would not let the unavailability of main dining room deter you from visiting the restaurant.
For drinks, we opted for the freshly squeezed mimosas. It was very well prepared. For appetizers, we ordered a side salad, which was amazing, the perfect amount of dressing and the presentation was great. We also ordered a dozen of the few oysters. As expected the oysters were very fresh and the accompanying mignonette sauce was perfect.
For the main entrees, we opted for probably the most popular dish on the menu, the clam pasta (linguine alle vongole) and also an order of the bolognese pasta. Hands down maybe the best bolognese I have had outside Italy. The clam pasta was also superb, loaded with fresh clams, and with the perfect amount of wine sauce. On a side note, we really appreciated how the restaurant made special arrangements to prepare a children's portion of the bolognese and they were able to plate it earlier than the rest of the meal.
Finished the meal off with an spritz, which would highly recommend for a brunch.
Overall, very pleased with the dining experience at Pink Door. It is no wonder why this restaurant continue to top the list of most popular restaurants in Seattle.","Natalie K.","This is a great Italian spot in Post Alley, it's a little hidden with the Pink Door... come early cause wait time usually is anywhere to 1-2 hours. And reservations are booked 60 days in advanced. You might get lucky and snag a seat at the bar
It's a cozy restaurant with dim lighting. Every night they do have live music/ entertainment.
We had a great server, he notified us that the menu changes every week/ holiday season so the pictures that you see you may not be able to order on the menu
To drink we started with Hennessy Sidecars ... can never go wrong
The Pink lasagna... sensational it didn't have meat but the sauce was impeccable and something like you probably have never tried before
The scallops were perfectly seared and crushed with potatoes and a sautéed spinach
The next dish was a Bellachini with Italian sausage... it was a little dry but still yummy with a cheese bite to it.
For desert we had a gelato tri and a chocolate cake with a chocolate coated pear... very rich but nice way to finish dinner off","Clarissa K.","This place I had bookmarked by recommendations from my fellow Yelp friends. I should have prepared better as it was truly hard to find located near Pike Place Market on a path that was a back alley. I did not realize that the door is truly a pale pink and in the dark the only way you will know you arrived. But it added to this great find and mysterious local and surroundings. Once inside you feel like you are in London in a hidden location in a basement.
So the wait for a table would be an eternity especially on a Wednesday cold dank evening in November. Luckily there was two seats at the bar so that is where we had our dinner. The menu was unbelievable like reading a poem each one you wanted to try. We sat next to all the regulars they seemed so happy. Great place it truly is one of a kind. We started with a anchovy dip with raw veggies. It was interesting as well as delicious. The main course I shared with my colleague any menu loses me when I see pappardelle noodles with Ragu a la Bolognese sauce. OMG to die for! We had a nice wine to compliment the meal as well as made it warmer before entering the cold Seattle night air. Grand Marnier Panna Cotta with fresh figs for a sweet ending
Will definitely return on my next visit to Seattle."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joey J.","Worth the hype. Great mix of flavors on all the dishes. The pasta was my favorite, but the sleeper may be the onions stuffed with sausage. Those were unreal and were generally eaten in one bite.
Cocktail list wasn't too expansive but they had something for everyone. Wine list is extensive and the atmosphere is pretty intimate. We had 5 pm reservations on a Tuesday and the place was packed by the time we left around 7.
Beef cheek was fork tender and dissolves in your mouth.","Trang L.","This restaurant is a must try if you are in Seattle! The hand-cut egg noodles tasted so fresh and perfectly al dente. The pork and beef ragu on top of the egg noodles were good, but a little bland for my taste. I've never had a cabbage salad that tasted so good. The prosciutto and egg added great texture and blended well with the crunchy cabbage. I'm not sure what kind of dressing was used, but it was delicious. The trout was crispy and full if flavor. Finally, the prawn risotto was amazing and a must try! I was so full and didn't have room for dessert.
Restaurant is small and intimate. Service is great!
I would rate this restaurant a 4.5 if I could and would come back again.","Stephen K.","Summary: If you solely come here for a specific pasta dish, you will leave satisfied. But everything else is as unmemorable as it gets- from the service to the house bread to the dessert to the $30 trout (more on this later).
Elon Musk. Stephen Curry. Bill Gates. The Backstreet Boys. What do these transcendent cultural icons all have in common you ask? They went against the grain. Against popular belief. And that is what I must do in saying, aside from one pasta dish, Spinasse is an average restaurant. To say I was hyped to have snagged a reservation on a weeks notice in one of the hardest restaurants to book in the city would be an understatement. And ya know, maybe the high expectations I came with me doomed my experience from the start so I'll take some culpability in the an overall experience that was just really average.
Nestled on the outskirts of Cap Hill, Spinasse exudes a romantic, intimate vibe from the moment you walk in. So at this point I'm thinking okay, this is my last meal with my significant other before they leave Seattle, and we gonna go out with a bang! Spinasse said nah, check yo self.
SIDE NOTE: It's a huge pet peeve of mine when restaurants try and make their menu a version of Webster's Dictionary Word of the Day that us peasants can't understand. Degustanzione, braciola, guancia, tajarin, barbabietole, who knows what these mean! Smh. But I suppose the Italian adds a flare to the authenticity and I'm probably just being dramatic since at least there are descriptions.
We ordered:
1. Tajarin con burro salvia (4/5 Stars) $15 small portion: The ICONIC hand cut egg pasta with butter and sage was light and flavorful. And it also tasted exactly like the Butter and Sage Gnocchi from Trader Joe's. The dish could have perhaps used a little bit more kick, but nonetheless I enjoyed it and marveled at the texture of such finely cut thin noodles. I've never quite eaten a noodle like that, and this brother has had a lot of noodles believe me.
2. Tajarin al ragu (5/5 Stars) $28 large portion: This dish was exemplary. The pork and beef ragu perfectly complimented the egg pasta, and even tasted a little sweet. And honestly, for all my asian noodle folks out there, the first thing I thought of was this meat tastes exactly like the mince pork of Rou Zhao Mian!!! Just Italian style. So that's probably why I loved it so much.
3. Agnolotti dal plin (3/5 Stars) $16 small portion: This is where the meal started going downhill. The agnolottis were absolutely tiny and filled with beef and pork. And while it didn't taste bad, the agnolottis were drowned in shaved cheese and left you feeling simply unsatisfied. I felt like I had to ration every one which was eaten in a half a bite because there were so few and each was so small. Granted we did get the small portion, but if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck, this ain't it.
4. Trota (2/5 Stars) $30: I almost fell out of my chair when this came out. Imagine a rectangle in your head, and and add a little fish tail to the end of it. That's exactly how the trout came out. I appreciated the fact that all the bones were plucked out, and the salsa of sage and golden raisins underneath was quite good- but the star of the dish is supposed to be the trout and it was so unmemorable. It had little to no flavor, and the presentation of a rectangle + tail left much to be desired. I was upset I didn't order another large of the tajarin al ragu with Trout money.
5. Torta al cioccolato (2/5 Stars) $11: The table beside us ordered this dish, and it looked SO APPETIZING. Plus I was desperate to salvage the meal and end it on a high note. And while the dark chocolate cake with buttercream wasn't bad, it wasn't good either. It tasted like a chocolate cake. It wasn't moist inside, but it was rock hard either. Nothing made me want to eat more, and I ate it out of the immigrant mentality of no food wasted upon which I was raised.
I would come back for the beef ragu, but that is it. I will also say our server again wasn't rude or bad, but she also didn't enhance the overall experience. She seemed a little disinterested and went through the motions, and did not provide genuine, heartfelt hospitality. Of course, we aren't entitled to amazing service by any means, but when a restaurant does have that amazing hospitality, it adds so much to the experience.
TIP: For $105/person, Spinasse has a deal where the table shares every single appetizer, pasta, and main entree dish on the menu (slightly smaller portions but still a good deal).","Ellen C.","Wow, their pastas are really really delicious. The noodles are really thin which really brings out the flavor. Based on the yelp reviews, we ordered 2 half order pastas (the ragu and the butter/sage), a kale dish, and the onion stuffed with meat. Everything was delicious and between the 2 of us, we were absolutely stuffed.
I loved that they offered reservations for a Saturday evening at 6:30PM. I also did make the reservation about 1 month in advance. Parking was really easy since it was an early dinner, and was able to find street parking right next to this restaurant.","Ivy L.","My friend loves this place and was absolutely adamant that we do our annual girl's holiday dinner here this year - so much so that even though the restaurant was booked, she called and left a message and was able to secure a reservation for us weeks in advance. I wasn't going to argue, I love pastas and homemade pastas are the absolute best! We had reservations during the holidays for a table of 5, and everything was set up and ready for us when we arrived. Parking wasn't horribly bad since it was on the outskirts of Capitol Hill, not in the mist of all the bars/restaurants/busy areas. We were able to find decent street parking quickly on a Friday night at 8pm. The restaurant itself is small and can be easily missed cause we definitely walked right passed it and had to turn around and walk back! It is a tiny little entrance right next to Altura, if you pass Altura by a lot, turn around! The is a double door leading to the interior to block out the wind, which is a nice touch. The interior is rustic and lightening makes it look like a candlelit tavern. The only complaint I had was the chairs - they were so so uncomfortable, it actually took away from my dining experience cause of how sunken the woven seats were and how erect the back was - please get new chairs!
Our server was quick and super friendly. We ordered a round of drinks, the Aperol Spritz was light and refreshing. We ordered 1 appetizer, 3 pastas, a main, and 2 sides to share between 5 girls and I thought the portions were definitely small. We were an ok full, but definitely not stuffed and could have maybe used a bit more food. The large pasta dishes were indeed on the smaller side, especially for the price. With that said, the pastas were good. We ordered the Agnolotti Dal Plin - little small pillows of delicious goodness. The tiny pillows were stuffed with such a flavorful concoction of meats and cheeses, beef and pork filled Agnolotti with a Double Brodo and Marjoram goodness to be excact. They were a burst of flavorful and the pasta was perfection (5/5). We also ordered the Tajarin con Burro e Salvia - basically a butter and sage pasta. Super simple but so much flavor. The tajarin pasta is Cascina Spinasse's signature dish - the super thin pasta is rare in most restaurants and Spinasse does it well. Lovely flavors of butter and sage, definitely the perfect ratio (5/5). And lastly, for the pastas, we ordered the Tajarin al Ragu. Again, an amazing ragu sauce with the right amount of cheese and the thin tajarin that just lets the sauce speak for itself. Delicious, albeit slightly on the salty side, just slightly. (5/5). My favorite dishes were indeed the pastas here - we also had two sides of kale and brussel sprouts - nothing to rave about there but a bit of greens to add to our carbo loading! The server recommended the Cipollini Ripiene - Roasted Cipollini Onions Stuffed with Beef and Pork Sausage with Toasted Pine Nuts and a side of bread as an appetizer and it was delicious! We had a friend who doesn't like onions but the mixture was cooked so well, you can't even taste the onions cause of the stuffed sausage. A good spread for the bread service (5/5). I also loved the amuse bouche, complimentary of the chef, the butter and anchovies toast was the most delicious mix and I would never think to serve butter with anchovies on top. Yum yum yum! I wish we could've ordered this dish alone. And our last dish was the special of the night, Pork Belly with Potatoes. The pork belly was tender and flavored well, though it wasn't my favorite dish of the night. The restaurant definitely stands out cause of the pastas!
Overall, good experience and lots of delicious dishes. Pastas, amuse bouche and appetizers were all fantastic. The sides and pork belly fell a little short, though definitely not bad by any means. For dessert we had the tiramisu and the panna cotta - by far the best panna cotta we've had in a long time. The tiramisu was in a small jar and was just ok - I think the panna cotta just stole the show! Service was good, ambiance homey, but chairs need to be replaced for comfort!","Jun Li Z.","Came here solo as I had always wanted to try this place out - it was in December. Sat at the bar and the waiters and waitresses alike were all friendly. There was one waiter - I forgot his name but he was super nice!
Service: Terrific and professional - almost fine dining-like.
Food: Ordered the appetizer - squash with bacon and nuts on it; thought I'd needed this one because I assumed the pasta wouldn't be enough. It was yummy but I actually didn't like squash as much. Ordered the beef ragu pasta and OMG it was toooooo good! I would order this again and again. I heard the butter and sage was also delicious!
Pricing: Be prepared to spend a bit more than your usual fare for dinner or lunch. This place is pricey - their service and quality of food makes up for it as they should if they are going to charge that much.
View from the Bar: If you are on a date or just traveling solo - I recommend sitting by the bar. I really enjoyed watching the workers make the pasta live! It was so fun to watch! You get to see them cut the noodles and slice and dice it. They seemed like perfectionist and made sure all of them were equal in size!","Sheryl K.","I want to start by saying that this is my most favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've tried many pasta places in the city, but Cascina Spinasse is my go-to. I even designated this spot to be my birthday dinner restaurant!
I am absolutely obsessed with their butter sage pasta. I don't know what it is about this dish, but it's so delicious. I could literally eat this every day.
I've had several dishes that I thoroughly enjoyed, but the butter sage pasta is what always stands out and what keeps me coming back. I don't think I've had anything that I didn't enjoy here. They also have amazing desserts. The last dessert I had was their tiramisu. I'm not a huge tiramisu fan, but I enjoyed theirs. It was so flavorful and delicious.
The only thing that bums me out about this place is that it's so popular and sometimes challenging to get a reservation in. Sometimes we go as early as possible to see if we can get bar seating. It's usually a hit or miss, but if they can fit us in, I'm generally down to wait for them to clear up some space.
If you're into delicious, freshly made pasta like me, you need to come here! But I highly recommend calling ahead to see if you can get a reservation. Otherwise, try getting there really early when they open for dinner to see if they can fit you in.","I L.","Everything was good.
Would order again by deliciousness:
Agnolotti
Onion stuffed sausage
pasta tajarin el ragu
The egg with cheese fondue was a bit too heavy for us. We ordered tajarin butter and sage a few years back - it was way too salty. Not sure if it was just an off night.
Service was exceptional.","Jennifer O.","I made a reservation for Spinasse four months ago and due to conflicts that kept coming up, I had to bump the reservation twice. I was so excited to come here with my hubby for date night last night and must say kudos all around.
Food: we usually splurge when it comes to date night and spared no expense at Spinasse. We ordered two small pastas, two entrees, a side of veggies and two desserts. We ordered the butter sage tajarin and the the agnolotti. The portions were definitely small which was perfect for shareable dishes. The tajarin was rich and buttery and kind of had this melt in your mouth aspect to it. It was good but i would likely get the version with meat my next time around. I'm a gal who likes meat. Then came out entrees. Hubby got the beef cheek dish and I got the trout. I was dumbfounded when what looked like an entire fish arrived in front of me - skin , tail and all! I was expecting a filet and that was def not what I got. It honestly didn't look appetizing at all but was well seasoned and damn delicious when I got into it. Hubby loved his dish as well. I liked how the flavors of both of our dishes were complex but yet light at the same time of that makes any sense. It was a sophisticated delight to eat. We had sautéed kale with our meal and while it was good, it was honestly a little too salty. Then came dessert. Hubby got the apple tart and I got tiramisu. Both were BOMB. The tiramisu was rich and creamy, so good. Highly recommend both! We left extremely satisfied!
Service: the food at Spinasse is 4.75 stars but the service tips it to 5 easily. As mentioned, we had a reservation for 6:45pm on Friday night. We arrived at the restaurant at exactly 6:45p and was seated IMMEDIATELY. So many restaurants fall short of this gold standard unfortunately. In addition to be being seated promptly, we were also tended to frequently and the wait staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.
Atmosphere: small cozy classy restaurant but sans the 'tude. I can dig it. The restaurant is lively without being loud. Most patrons were on intimate dates and this is perfect spot for it.
Overall: excellent date night spot. Excellent food. Will return absolutely.","Rio D.","Precaution: I'm very picky in general when it comes to food. I have very delicate pallet and I've traveled abroad a lot and gone to many restaurants. Especially when it comes to Italian, I tend to be a bit unfair because I'm used to Italian-Italian (lived there and visited many times.) So I should say maybe they are five but I just miss the authentic Italian. So four star. But everything else is good. Nice restaurant, service, menu, atmosphere, hip and trendy. Perfect for date night.","Alina H.","BEST DINNER EVER. Max was our waiter and was so knowledgeable and fun! He asked us lots of questions and helped us pick so many perfect courses. Service was insanely quick and some of the best Italian food I've ever had (outside of Italy)! Go go go go so worth it.","Michael P.","One of the first Italian stops in Seattle: @spinasseseattle
Get a reservation because seats are definitely hard to come by! If I were to recommend anything, the pastas are phenomenal. STICK WITH THESE. You cannot go wrong. Be blessed. Both tajarins are staples of the restaurant and are the only pastas that do not get changed on the menu.
1. Antipasto misto della casa: uva con gorgonzola (fresh grapes with Gorgonzola piccante, hazelnuts, chicories, and parmigiana-filo crisps), vitello tonnato (poached veal loin with tuna maionese, parsley, and fried capers), insalata di peperoni (roasted peppers with chickpea purée, boiled egg, and anchovies), and prosciutto di Parma (pio tosino 14-month aged prosciutto with fresh melon)
2. Tajarin al ragù: fine hand-cut egg pasta with pork and beef ragù
3. Agnolotti dal plin: beef and pork filled agnolotti with double brodo and majoram
4. Pancetta ripiena: prosciutto-stuffed pork belly with roasted marble potatoes and rosemary
Tongue? Blessed.","Madeline C.","Absolutely wonderful experience, including the food, service, and atmosphere. We made a reservation which was a good choice as our table was ready right when we arrived. I loved the warm, cozy Italian ambiance. We had the stuffed pearl onions (cipollini ripiene) as an appetizer which melted in our mouths with every bite. Then, we split the pasta dish tajarin al ragu, which was very rich and delicious, along with a side of the Zucca (I was skeptical of squash but it was very good and filling with yummy nuts and and Parmesan on top). Definitely a bit pricey but so wonderful for a special occasion or date night!","Derek B.","I had high expectations going into this, and I was not let down. I get nervous when I have to give a credit card in advance for a reservation, but I was dedicated and ready to commit. This place had been on my list for a while. OpenTable only had reservations very late in the evening, and when we called via phone (the horror!), they were able to accommodate seating us earlier, which was amazing because I was exhausted.
It has a dark ambiance. I don't know what rustic actually means, but maybe it was that? The table was ready and set up when we got there, so that was appreciated. The server was very cool. And that didn't prevent him from being very polite and providing excellent service throughout the meal.
The bruschetta was not what I typically think of when I think of bruschetta but it was amazing. The tajarin is one of their staple things, and I enjoyed that. The cavatelli with braised beef short rib ragu was definitely to the next level goodness. At this point in ordering food, I was nervous that I wouldn't be able to eat more, but somehow that wasn't an issue when the food came out and ordering the pancetta was not a mistake.
We ended the meal with this chocolate torta thing that was so balanced - it wasn't too heavy or overly chocolately. And the grappa pairing that they recommended was so on point.
I will definitely be coming back. I appreciate the great service, the recommended pairings worked really well, and all of the dishes that were ordered were consistently excellent.","Thao N.","Finally got the pleasure to come here to try out their famous butter & sage pasta. One of those small, intimate settings with the dim lighting that I appreciate, but that means no photos for you guys;) The plates looked tiny, but is actually very filling so I recommend you getting a few of the half size pastas for more variety.
Going back to the butter & sage pasta, literally all my clients have been raving this so I've had it on my radar for a while now. I think they used actual angel hair because it was magical. It's one of those food porn moments, where it enters your mouth and might explode from all the bomb flavor.
Highly recommend coming here for any special occasion; birthdays, anniversaries, death of evil boss, or if you're a foodie like me and love exploring new places on a random Tuesday to avoid crowds, although this popular spot is busy all the time.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)","Spat S.","Top food and service. Sat at the bar on a Friday night, great atmosphere and could see the pasta being freshly made in the kitchen. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about all the dishes. Wines were amazing. Highly recommend the butter pasta staple, the ragu was also nice but didn't love it as much. Would definitely come back!","Jennifer Y.","Took an uber pool here - I suggest you do the same. Or walk? Seattle really isn't that stretched out the more you think about it.
Entrance is such a tease - what's behind those lovely white curtains? A magical place. Who knew that somewhere so cozy could exist on these cold rainy streets? There is one dining area (smaller) directly where you enter, then another (larger) adjacent to the left. The kitchen is visible through a glass windowpane where you can watch the pasta being made fresh and all the other happenings of the making of your food.
They're very friendly and understanding here. The moment you sit they ask you about any allergies or dietary restrictions. They're very clean - they clean every time they take away a plate. If you sit at the 'bar' - really it's just a nice view of the kitchen - they don't have hooks underneath the bar but they encourage you to hang coats on your seat or on their coat hanger hooks to the side.
Complimentary Crostinis
- Rabbit Liver Pate
Now I've never had pate so perhaps I'm just not cultured enough. But have you ever drank too much, then felt sick and thrown up? That after taste of thrown up alcohol is what this tasted like. I'm not trying to exaggerate or be overly rude, it's just exactly what this taste reminded me of.
- Butter and Anchovy
A lot of pepper. And a LOT of salt - tastes like extra salty fried fish. So, SO salty. Possibly too salty. But significantly better than the liver pate.
Tajarin con Burro e Salvia
Basically a very thinly sliced tagliatelle with butter and sage. This is a common combination but the first time I'd tried it. The sage didn't seem to mesh very well to me and the butter seemed almost like an aftertaste. The pasta however was undoubtedly fresh (not just because I'd seen them make it) but because it was so soft and rich. So soft it seemed like it should fall apart in your mouth but somehow still retained texture.
Carote Arrotiste
Huge, huge chunks of carrot. I wouldn't recommend getting this for one person because it could be a whole meal in and of itself. They were perfectly cooked but that's where the positives ended. Sweet then sour then various herb flavors - didn't seem like any of it meshed well together. The sour came through very, very strong.","Rosa K.","I've been wanting to try out this place for so long and I finally got my chance! I came here on a Friday night (after 8pm) and I didn't make a reservation. I was hoping that since we got there around 8:30pm, we wouldn't have too long of a wait....they said the wait was 1.5 hours. SO DON'T FORGET- MAKE A RESERVATION! We weren't in a rush so we put our names down and go to the Italian restaurant next door to grab a drink and an appetizer (Artusi) while we waited (you can read my review for that separately :) )
We got the call around 9:45pm that our table was ready. We headed over there. I knew that I wanted to try the Tajarin but I couldn't decided if I wanted to go simple with the butter sage or the ragu. We decided to do BOTH. The pasta noodles were SO thin and just melted in my mouth.
Though the noodles were the same, the taste of the two dishes were so different. I did love the simplicity of the butter sage, but I felt that there was more flavor in the Tajarin al ragu (I love meat sauce). The butter sage had such a rich but delicate taste. The hint of sage elevated the pasta to feel elegant. The Tajarin al ragu is more of a homey taste. It has more ""umph"" from the tomatos and the meat which is right up my alley.
We got the smaller size of each of them and we were able to eat them both (even after our appetizer meal next door). The pasta noodles aren't as heavy and filling like ""normal"" pasta noodles which was a nice because I didn't feel as full or bloated.
The service was amazing, the waiter was so friendly- went through the menu, portion sizes and wine selection.
I definitely don't regret getting both the Tajarin dishes. I will definitely be back!","Owlburt L.","Went here last Saturday with the wife and our daughter for a belated birthday dinner. I had been excited and had high expectations based on the reviews. I booked this over a month ago and was hoping for a great experience.
Unfortunately we were both quite disappointed. The service was good but that is expected for a high end restaurant like this.
The food, however, was a major disappointment.
We started with the Uva Con Gorgonzola and the Cippollini Ripiene (both highly recommended by our waiter). The Uva Con Gorgonzola was an interesting dish most of which is I have never paid $15 for about 10 green and red grapes cut in half with 5 crumbled pieces of cheese and some hazelnuts. The balance just wasn't there for us. The grapes were sweet, the dressing has some zing to it and the cheese was just too salty. The Cippollini Ripiene wasn't too bad but it was again, overly salted.Unfortunately the ""overly salty"" theme was to be repeat itself to every dish we ordered afterwards.
And I am someone who usually puts extra salt on everything. Hell I even have slightly high blood pressure because of the amount of sodium I ingest.
We then ordered half orders the Tajarin al Ragu and Agnolotti dal plin and the Pancetta Ripiena. Although all the dishes were not badly made, the fact that all them were overly salty, ended up overpowering any ""complex"" flavoring that might have existed under it.
With drinks our bill came out to abut $180 plus gratuity. In the end was basically $100 per person (since our daughter didn't really eat anything), which is way overpriced for something that was nothing special and overly salty.
We won't be back and that's unfortunate since we really wanted to like this place. I am not a penny pincher when it come to eating out, I don't mind shelling out the money for good food, but why pay 4 times more for something you can get at places Il Nilo or Il Corvo that is much better.","Dan C.","I was looking for a good place for an anniversary dinner, and just did a web search for good restaurants for special occasions in Seattle. Spinasse was maybe the third one that came up, but they had me at fresh made pasta. And oh my, the pasta...
But im skipping ahead. The restaurant itself is nondescript from the outside, sandwiched between a couple of other Capitol hill eateries. Inside is clean and close, with a rustic feel. Depending on where you sit, you can watch pasta being made in the kitchen... long sheets of beautiful, yellow, eggy pasta... I'm getting hungry again..
Service was prompt, friendly, and generally fantastic, with care given to cleaning the table between courses and being careful to not touch the silverware and plates as they were being replaced. We even got an extra candle and a couple of Happy Anniversaries! towards the end of our meal.
The food was even better. To start, we had a poached egg in cheese fondue and a savory shallot flan served over spinach and topped with fried shallots. Both were excellent, but I could eat that flan every day for a year.
Main courses were pasta in brown butter sage sauce, and prosciutto-stuffed pork belly. The pasta was, in a word, perfect. The stuffed pork belly was pork stuffed in more pork, with an herbed demi-glaze, and roasted potatoes. Awesome.
I finished up with an apple crostata, paired with an excellent grappa, and my Mrs. had the lemon curd and ricotta layered mousse.
I've had meals all over the world, and this was in my top 5 best meals so far. The ratings already reflect it, but this is a restaurant worth checking out more than once; we literally started planning our next meal there about halfway through this one."
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kathryn C.","I had the most wonderful experience at this restaurant!
Tim, the owner, had an excellent wine special by the glass that paired perfectly with my starter of meatballs in a hearty marinara sauce. The meatballs were so delectable!
I appreciated the option of more Parmesan, fresh cracked pepper and red chili flakes throughout my meal as I like things a little spicy.
For the next course I had the Pomodoro Caprese and the tomatoes tasted so very fresh! The mozzarella, olive oil, balsamic and basil were top quality which all together made this delicious!
For my main course I had the Carbonara and if you are a fan of this creamy pasta dish with egg and panceta it does not disappoint.
To finish off my meal I had the in house made tiramisu and some limoncello. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.
Tim and his staff have definitely got the right vibe in this Ristorante Italiano with great conversation, fantastic wine and food and a comforting overall ambience. I will be back!","Jenny Z.","WOW the food here is amazing! Ate the leftovers for lunch today and honestly just as good. We came here for my husband's birthday dinner. I booked through Yelp for the first time and it was quite convenient.
We came on a busy Saturday night for an 8 pm reservation. Even though we came about 10 min early, we got sat right away. We started with a bottle called Marchesi which is a sangio/cab blend (mostly sangio) which was light with main note of cherry. I did wish it had more cab since we like fuller body wines, but the lightness ended up pairing well with our meal.
For apps we ordered the olives, caprese salad and caesar salad. Olives came out hot which I had never had before! It was flavorful and tasted amazing with their bread. The caprese salad was a generous portion and fresh tasting. Caesar was good as well. I added anchovies which were extremely salty...almost cured? I would pass on that next time, especially if you're expecting fresh anchovies like I was.
For dinner I ordered the seafood special. Husband ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola with chicken (after reading the review that the person could die happy after eating it lol). Both were amazing. I personally liked the seafood dish more. Very fresh seafood and perfectly al dente pasta. The gnocchi dish was rich and creamy and the chicken was tossed on top, which cut the creaminess in a good way.
Overall food tasted delicious and authentically Italian and will definitely be back to try more pasta. Next time we will definitely try the carbonara which had raving reviews. I also enjoyed the wine list which offered wines from several Italian regions. It's always nice to try a bottle you can't normally order from a Seattle restaurant. The ambiance was really nice and felt like you were transported to a little Italian restaurant in Trastevere.
The downside for us was the lackluster service, especially for a birthday dinner. Friendly server but forgot several things (forgetting to put in our appetizer order, asking several times whose birthday it was despite me writing it into the notes of the reservation and telling him, asking me to remind about the bday dessert, giving us another table's filled out receipt instead of my card back, etc.)
Just a little bit more thoughtfulness would have made the birthday dinner less chaotic-seeming. Good thing husband does not care all that much about bdays :) All in all a very nice dinner despite the unconventional service lol.","Elly S.","I really want to like this place. It's very convenient with a warm atmosphere, friendly staff and a variety of tasty food options. Both times I've been, the food has been slow to come out but this isn't usually more than a nuisance, especially on busy nights. However, on Saturday night my husband's order was lost/forgotten, and he ended up waiting about 15 minutes longer for his food - a large seafood pasta dish. They were very kind about the mistake and even comped a couple desserts. In hindsight, though, I worry that the staff rushed to make the food in order to address the error, since my husband has had symptoms of food poisoning since the morning after, and undercooked seafood seems a very likely culprit.
Again, I want to like this place, but I don't think we will go back. For those who do go, I recommend the tiramisu and would steer clear of any shellfish.","Monica K.","We celebrated our friend's birthday here for dinner last weekend. The restaurant was able to accommodate our large group fairly well.
I enjoyed the burrata appetizer - it was my first time trying burrata, and I thought it was good (though I have nothing to compare it with). I ordered the pasta special of the night, and got to try a little bite of my friends' pasta dishes. For all the pasta dishes I tried, I think they were good but not particularly amazing.
What stood out for me the most was Tim, who served us that night. He was extremely energetic, joyful, quick, and funny. He handled our large group with grace. I really appreciated the extra effort he put into giving us a positive experience!","Mike N.","Led to Brunello by the 4 1/2 star rating. While I was expecting an old style neighborhood Italian restaurant, I was underwhelmed when I walked in. It was a bit more ""rustic"" than I anticipated. Menu was mostly pastas but also had chicken and veal entrees. But this was ideal for the evening as I was looking for pasta along with the Huskies I was feeding. I ordered the only homemade pasta on the menu, the gnocchi with red sauce and meatballs. The gnocchi pillows were really good. However the sauce was way too spicy to my liking and I like heat but in this case it took away from the gnocchi. And the smallish meatbballs were bland. Service was excellent. You can expect a decent meal just don't come with expectations that you'll be blown away which a Yelp rating like it has will do.","Kristin B.","April of this year when I went to Brunello. I had gnocchi with marinara sauce, which is one of my favorite dishes. It was delicious! I am all about sauce and this dish had it. The sauce was plentiful and tasty. The gnocchi was on point. If you're in the Roosevelt neighborhood, I would definitely make sure to give this Italian restaurant a try.
Accessibility: This place is accessible. There are no steps to get in nor any booths to worry about. It will be a tight squeeze when it is busy though. The flooring is raised tiles so it may be bumpy for any wheelchair users. I do not remember the washroom situation. I would inquire.","Jasmine S.","Cozy atmosphere and authentic Italian flavors! A bit difficult to get the staff's attention as they were super packed that night, but overall a great experience.","Stacy S.","Had a weekday dinner here, based on reviews from other Yelpers. We were not disappointed.
The menu had a great selection, and the food we ordered was tasty. I had a vegetarian pasta dish and he had a seafood pasta special. The portion size is very generous for the amount of each dish. The wine menu was decent and the service was very good. Our only complaint was that the vanilla gelato tasted more like ice cream than actual gelato, so that was a bit frustrating.","Mikala K.","My husband loved his salmon pasta with lemon butter, capers and white wine sauce $29. I had the lasagna but lil too cheesy and very little meat or marinara sauce to relish on $14. The bread was actually bland but was improved by dipping it in balsamic vinegar and olio. Yet, if their entrees are this delish, then the bread should match the food quality. I highly recommend they try a better recipe or buy better tasting bread. I am a bread fanatic and unwarranted and unofficial bread connoisseur so if I dont like the bread, then the rest of the meal we be subpar automatically.","Paulina H.","Food: 9/10 (Seafoods are fresh, not too spicy, everything taste perfect! But the pasta is a little salty.
Environment: 10/10 (great to sit outside when it's sunny and enjoy some wine)
Service: 10/10","Joe M.","This place is awesome! I've driven past this place for a couple of years and decided to try it. Wow glad I did. The service was top notch and the food was even better. The drinks were great and the bread was to die for. If you want a treat go here. Blown away! Great job guys!","Elena G.","It was a bit disappointing experience. After reading the reviews we decided to book the restaurant for my birthday when we arrived we were given the menus and were offered to taste some wine, which wasn't good. Then we ordered a more expensive bottle of wine from Brunneli's brand but the waiter decided to use the same glasses that he brought the wine to taste. When politely pointed to get us fresh glasses, his attitude was rather unpleasant. The food was very average. The lasagna was disappointing. The calamari were too chewy. The Fish stew was fine.
We see big fans of Italian cuisine. So really unfortunate experience.","Clarissa L.","We came here as it was a short drive from our Airbnb.
Delicious food! Free street parking, friendly staff, quiet atmosphere, any pasta dish can be made as a half portion for children","Brice B.","A great, affordable Italian restaurant with a cozy, authentic dining area. It's very unassuming from the outside and location. The service is great as well.","Amy F.","Hard five stars! We were here on a Friday night and the place was packed. The food was tasty, warm ambiance, easy parking. The server recommended a nice Barbaresco and recommended family-style dining, which worked out beautifully. Even though it was packed, they didn't hurry us out. I will return for sure.","Mayson L.","I'm giving this place a 3.5/5 just by the food.
It's a small mom and pops kind of Italian restaurant which kind of makes you feel at home. The staff and waiters are super friendly and will make sure your water is never empty! Spectacular service. It was nice of them to offer all the dinner specials in a very well manner.
The food was just okay. I'm from Los Angeles and I was being too harsh comparing it to my favorite Italian restaurant back home. I got the spaghetti bolognese and fettuccini pesto. Both were a bit bland in my opinion. Meatballs were tasty though!
Overall, this is a nice date spot! They have plenty of wine options as well. Bye Seattle!","Kerri K.","It was our first time there and we will definitely return! Warm atmosphere, great food and friendly staff. Last night they had lobster spaghetti as a special dish(with saffron)--yum!","non o.","It's been a while since we ate here, so we came to try again. WOW! I noticed that last time I gave 4 stars but now I want to change to 5 stars! Everything we ate were delicious and we cleaned all the plates! We had meatballs, salad, bolognese (so creamy and great), I had squid spaghetti which was also great, and chicken marsala which was fantastic! Writing this review makes me hungry... definitely go back there again soon!","Felisa D.","I had been at the restaurant that used to be in this location. It was also Italian. That was as much as I can remember about it. Other than that, I don't quite remember how the food or service was.
My husband and I had an impromptu date night. We wanted to go to the Crest, but we wanted to eat out before the movie. I suggested this place because I had a hankering for pasta.
I tend to expect neighborhood joints to be good at best. And that's sometimes okay if you're, like us, hungry and desperate.
Look, I'm not saying this like being in Italy. But the food was pretty good. I generally don't love Italian-American cuisine because it tends to be too cheesy. This place served food that was between Jersey Italian-American and artisanal regional Italian cuisine if that makes sense. Like they at least have the decency not to batter and fry their calamari... But they do have your heavy sauces if you want your pasta that way. We enjoyed our pasta dishes and the service was very warm. It's not the cheapest meal but was quite reasonable everything considered.
For specifics: I'm not sure how I feel about the bread. It's served warm (which was fantastic!) but I just wish it has a little bit more crust and bite. The pasta we had was al dente and the sauces had a pretty good balance. I ordered the penne vodka while my husband ordered the linguini vongole. The penne vodka was good but was missing... Something. I asked for a side of parsley and was given some chiffonade basil lol that actually worked! It just needed a little brightness to balance the heavy creaminess of it. My husband enjoyed his dish but said it was also missing something. It was just a little bit of sauce.
Overall, we would come back.","Derek F.","This place has become a fast favorite of mine! The service is absolutely amazing, the owner is super charismatic and takes the time to actually get to know his customers making the experience something else. The food is fantastic to boot! I especially love their homemade Gnocchi Gorgonzola."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Tay W.","Atmosphere: Dark and lively.
Service: Awesome! Our waiter gave great recommendations and checked in on us regularly.
Food: My fiancé got the rigatoni & I got the Pappardelle. Both dishes were amazing. If you like your pasta fully cooked, be sure to let your waiter know. Their pasta is cooked al dents--a bit firm. It didn't taste bad, but I wouldn't have mind if it was cooked a little bit more!","Natasha G.","I've come to Tavolata twice now and while the overall experience is passable, my 3 star rating is bc nothing really blew me away. In my most recent visit, I came with a large party (14 people) for my friends birthday dinner. My first of three stars this place gets is for the service - we were able to create a customized tasting menu including appetizers, pasta, entrees, sides, AND dessert for the birthday, with a mix of veg and non-veg options to meet the needs of various people in our party. The waiters were friendly and attentive throughout, and I'll add another star for an ambiance that is good for special occasions with large groups to date vibes or intimate friend group dinners.
The food didn't wow me though - I've had much more memorable Italian in a 5 mile radius of this place. We started with a standard meat board (it's hard to mess that up), burrata that honestly was bland, and fried lard which tasted a bit rubbery and not fresh. The pastas (potato gnocchi and ravioli) were also just ok - the ravioli had a weird honey taste mixed with the savory sauce, and while some cuisines nail the mix of savory and sweet, I don't think Italian pasta is the right place to try it (at least this one). Finally, the pork chop was hard to bite, chew, and swallow - it honestly tasted like a dish you would get at a college dining hall. The farroto (off the menu veg item), as well as the rapini, however, were decent - the garlic/lemon zest on the rapini was a nice palette cleanse from the pasta and the farroto was a solid veg risotto. My third star is for those dishes. Finally, the lemon donut dessert was fine, but again, better donuts and dessert options within a 5 min walk from here (cue Salt & Straw, General Purpose, and Frankie & Joes).
If you do end up coming here for some reason, ask for the Farroto and rapini and it'll satisfy your taste buds while enjoying the vibrant ambiance. I wouldn't waste your calorie intake or $$ on anything else from here.","Lisa C.","My husband and I decided to go here for my birthday. I had heard so many good things about it and it was an Ethan Stowell restaurant after all.
It was very unimpressive. The buratta appetizer with lemon curd like topping was delicious. But it ended there. That should have been recommended as a dessert, not appetizer. The eat if the meal, pasta, was overpriced for what it tasted like and the amount.
The most odd thing which may sound great... But was awkward for me was we had three different servers take our appetizer order and hence we were confused what was really going to come and if we would get duplicates. It all worked out as we tried to be clear that another waiter had taken our order. But I found that burden and all the interruptions very uncomfortable.
Anyway, I was underwhelmed.","Peter C.","So so so much to like about Tavolata. Get the bread basket - it comes with this delicious spreadable cheese and balsamic vinegar. But the star is the spreadable cheese -it will blow your mind how flavorful it is. They didn't have any specials that night, so I played it safe with spaghetti & meatballs. But goodness gracious this is nothing like what you can make at home, and that's the whole fun of eating out. It's covered in a pile of parmesan with sturdy, firm noodles and it's SO good. Run, don't walk to this one. Slightly dim lighting so you might think it's a romantic date spot, but it's kind of loud on the inside, unless you're lucky enough to get a quiet corner somewhere. Anyway, just go and thank me later.","Camille W.","My friend and I were exploring Capitol Hill and happened upon Tavolata and we were both pleasantly surprised! It happened to be 15 min before happy hour ended and the barista took our orders in just in time. One thing I will say is I do not think I would be as happy paying full price for what we got, which is why it is 3.5 stars.
We ordered the arugula salad, bruschetta, spaghetti, and rosemary gimlets. The arugula salad was crisp, cheesy, and lemon-y exactly what you're looking when consuming a bitter salad. It was actually my favorite part of the meal ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The spaghetti was a little too anchovy-y which I found odd since I was searching for the salt and pepper shakers... the meatballs were good but the flavor was lacking. The pasta appeared to be fresh pasta but was just a tad too al dente. My friend and I both agreed within our first bite that it should've had more time in the hot water, but the parm shavings were a nice touch. The bruschetta did not come had we not asked about it, which was fine with us since we were working on our other choices, but I had to ask for that. But it was sourdough bread with a very unique dip and a side of olive oil and balsamic.
Sitting at the bar made me realize how tricky it must be to multitask all the aspects of a full menu and drinks for the whole restaurant. The gal at the bar handled it like a champ. The rosemary gimlet was actually one of the most memorable! Refreshing, perfect amount of rosemary taste and citrus and relatively strong on the gin, which is an excellent balance. Our bill was $30 each with tip which I thought was still on the higher end for what we got.
All in all, I would perhaps try it again if I were coerced into it but I don't know if the pasta made that much of an impression to me to come back. I've had better pasta elsewhere, maybe I just didn't order the right thing?","Huong L.","This was on my list of Seattle restaurant week and it did not disappoint at all.
We made reservations for 6 on Monday and got seated right away. I was interested in their happy hour menu as well and they were able to accommodate us for the bar area.
The menu was awesome for SRW - you get to choose an appetizer, entree and dessert on their regular menu!
- Brussels sprouts - filling, good texture, a little bland
-albacore with mussles - interesting, the albacore was thick cut and cooked medium rare. It was bland but went well with the mussles and sauce
-sorbetto - ice cream went well with the cookie, but wasn't sure where the sweet and salty came from as both was sweet. The ice cream was coconut lime and was good.
The HH menu was also awesome!
-bruschetta - fish was good and was a lot on the crunchy/soft bread. Flavor was spot on.
-parpadelle - favorite meat sauce, and the pasta was cooked perfectly
Price and portion for both menu was generous and I would definitely come back! Service was ok, not particularly amazing but better than what I expected. This is probably one of the best SRW restaurant Ive been to.","Cindy V.","Lovely environment. Romantic for dates and a great spot for happy hour - Pasta dishes running less than $15 that are filling! My favorite from the happy hour menu is the rigatoni with spicy sausage. Delicious, makes me want to get more every time. The gnocchi is also decent, no complaints.
The chicken ravioli is super bomb, I definitely recommend this dish (not on HH). At first I thought this dish was small but was filling even though I was super hungry.
Bruschetta with smoked fish - the fish is amazing! Tasted very fresh. I just wish the bread was a little softer. It was a little too crunchy to our liking but still a solid appetizer. I also tried the olive appetizer before but didn't really enjoy it.
I've only gone here for dinner and the wait for the food is pretty long. Service is okay nothing spectacular. I would suggest making reservation to avoid long lines for the weekend since it can get pretty busy or if you want to sit at the booth.","Joey J.","This place gets busy very, very fast. We were able to sneak into the bar area for some dinner. Cocktails were good, but the mai tai was very fruity. Espresso martinis were espresso forward.
The steak tartare was good, but almost too cold. I had the spaghetti with anchovy off the happy hour menu and it was the highlight. My wife had the tagliatelle with scallops, and she hated it. Scallops were diced up and the Alfredo type of sauce was off. It was honestly inedible but we were told it was a new add to the menu and delicious. It's also one of, if not the most expensive pasta on the menu.
I would go back for happy hour and just order off that menu. 4 stars without the tagliatelle factored in.","Simone T.","Well I am biased, because I met the love off my life at Tavolàta when my friend and I were at happy hour one evening. I love this place so much and am so grateful for it. The pasta and bread spread is always delicious and hopefully we will spend our anniversary here for years to come. If you happen to go for ddinner make sure to get some bubbly as well because they have a wonderful selection to pair with dinner.","Ju C.","Burrata: The cheese was just so fresh and well balanced with pear
Ricotta ravioli: The ravioli had the perfect amount of chew. The Sauce was nutty, zesty and sweet, perfect with ricotta cheese.
Pappardelle: This was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. The handmade pasta was so good and the ragu sauce was just a little spicy and minty so not greasy at all.","Theresa L.","Belltown as usual parking is horrible on a Saturday night. Luckily found a parking spot not far.
Booked a table a month in advanced. When we arrived we waited a little while but was seated fairly quickly. We sat at a shared communal table. Food came out hot and tasted great. Hand made in house pasta was perfect. The pork chop was so big, perfectly cooked. We enjoyed the pork chop over the beef.
We will go back again but must allow time to find parking.","Siddhartha G.","'Woohoo as good as it gets' is just about right for Tavoláta, I don't believe I've had better Italian cuisine in recent memory. My sample space though is only the bay area, but San Jose's Little Italy restaurants can hold their own.
The novelty factor at Tavoláta is high, beginning with super-spicy Calabrian spice roasted pistachios and ending with hazelnut chocolate topped with the bitterest grapefruit marmalade you'll ever have. Get it while you can, when I tried asking for the marmalade's source they told me it's only temporarily on the menu.
And of course, if the start and the end are so good, how could they falter on the middle course? Main entreé was a cheesy sumptuous semolina ravioli delight, the Gnocchi alla Romana.
It would be worth coming back to Seattle just to eat at Tavoláta again.","Kristen K.","My best friend in Seattle recommended this restaurant as his favorite Italian spot in the city, so we decided to make a reservation when a group of us were in the city.
It was a rainy Sunday evening and the restaurant was not too full when we came in for our reservation.
We each order our own dishes and I got to try some of my friend's dishes as well. Everything was very well plated and delicious (al dente)!!
Food:
Pappardelle - My friend and I split the Pappardelle and the spaghetti. I like the pappardelle more because it was a meat sauce and I haven't had an anchovy sauce before on my pasta. Both pastas were perfectly al dente and a pretty sizeable portion.
Anchovy Spaghetti with side meatballs - Meatballs were delicious! The spaghetti was a bit more fishy than I expected, but I liked the pasta overall. It was just more overpowering than I thought.
My friends all seemed very happy with their pasta dishes (also the salumi board was excellent). We all pretty much cleaned up all of the food somehow. I think the bucatini might have been a clear winner of the pastas though.
Overall, really delicious Italian restaurant in Capitol Hill. Very nice space and excellent service. Definitely would recommend coming here to try some delicious pastas!","Kevin Z.","Pretty run of the mill Italian fare. We had a large table come in for a birthday dinner. We ordered the rigatoni, papparadelle, tagliatelle, spaghetti and meatballs, hanger steak, and porchetta. The pastas were ultimately forgettable as the flavors and textures were decent but nothing special. Visually, the porchetta was stunning but came to our table very cold and had to be reheated. The dish ended up being disappointing because it was fairly one dimensional favor wise.
Overall, service was great but food left much to be desired.","Amy L.","Went here after work with coworkers on a Thursday night, and was able to get reservations quickly.
The food was pretty fancy and delicious, but a little pricey. The servers/ staff were very nice and friendly.
I will definitely come for another try!","Sara C.","Really great and authentic pasta without the wait! I can't say enough great things about this place. From service to food, every experience I've had has been wonderful. The restaurant is very accommodating of big groups, staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and careful with food allergies. The kitchen is on it! Food is fresh and delicious. Menu is fun and adventurous, and talk about that happy hour menu too.The atmosphere is trendy yet sophisticated.
Just go, you won't regret it, maybe make a reservation ahead of time. It's the little things, the attention to detail that add up into one great experience. I'm determined to try everything on their menu!","Cary H.","Trendy Italian restaurant with friendly, accommodating staff and well-dressed diners. The happy hour crowd brightens the room and it quiets down after 7.
We ordered almost half the menu and ate family style. Ingredients were of high quality and very fresh. The preparation was disappointing. Some entrees were were bland, and others were over seasoned. The branzino was overcooked into a dry mess. Also pasta was inconsistent, varying from hard/al-dente to mushy soft. Only standout was the perfect lamb-mousse bruschetta.
Yelp pictures and trendy menu are deceiving. Happy hour prices for a quick bite/cocktail is probably fine. But for fine Italian dining, Tavolàta is just not there. I have high hopes they can work on consistent preparation as those guys in the kitchen seem like they are really trying.","Ellen C.","This place is always consistent in terms of food and service. Came back during Seattle Restaurant Week ($35 for 3 courses). Got an appetizer (salumi board), an entree (opted for the confit chicken instead of pasta since I always get pasta here), and dessert (panna cotta). Loved every single thing as usual!
I was also introduced to the Zeppole (lemon donuts with powdered sugar that you dip into a chocolate sauce) which was AMAZING. GAH. Next time I head to Tavolata I'm definitely ordering that for dessert.","Robyn C.","You can't go wrong with their happy hour. I've had the spaghetti and chicken meatballs as well as the gnocchi.
Fresh pasta that's perfectly aldente with light and flavorful meatballs and a rich red sauce. The portion is pretty big too. I believe it was under $15.
The gnocchi is not you typical baby pillows. These are fluffy euro pillows tucked in a cute baby casserole dish- blanketed with sauce. The gooey cheese helps too!","Carmen V.","Great to remember Italian sounding restaurants you marked in your mental 'to try' list from a previous visit to Seattle. In this case, remembering the Tavolata name saved my night, as my colleague and I were literally fighting and almost grabbing each other's hair to go and have dinner together somewhere were we both could enjoy. My colleaguefriend is Indian and somehow picky with her food intake.
Myself, I am in ketosis mode and with bad mood for cutting bread from my diet plus all that sugar...therefore irritable. Tavolata saved our night. My colleaguefriend enjoyed her pasta (al dente, not hard! ) and I definitively went fully keto, with that halibut in romesco sauce and shared an octopus carpaccio mega delicious with her. Also, had an non alcoholic cocktail that was so good you forgot it has no alcohol in it.
Great quality food and very nice atmosphere. Looks like mostly customers were pretty girls in pairs (well, not talking for ourselves in this case) and some matc.com kind of couples just on a first date. Packed but fast and friendly service."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica L.","This is my favorite pasta place in Seattle! I heard so many great things about it for a few years but finally tried it this past March. The pasta is fresh and the sauces are delicious. Even though the wait was super long (about 90 min)on a Friday in August, it was honestly worth the wait.
One of my favorites was the spicy sauce pasta with octopus. The menu changes daily so make sure to check out their Instagram page before you head there.","Phillip N.","Unique pastas everyday, high quality ingredients, delicious food!
Il Corvo deserves the hype it gets. I recommend checking their Instagram before you go to see what their daily pstas are, but if you're too lazy, their bolognese is always a solid go-to pasta. The pasta has a very nice bite to them and the meat is very savory and packs a heavy punch.
The line gets long but doesn't stay stagnant.","Dione L.","If you are trying to find the best pasta in Seattle. Its going to be right here. The line and preparing to wait in a lie isn't just the hype. The hype is seriously real. Please get the salad and focaccia if you're going to wait the whole time. I always get their bolognese because its just so good. I literally have dreams about the pasta and most importantly with sauce.
This place is truly unique because they post/ rotate their menu everyday and they only keep the bolognese. SOOOO GET THE BOLOGNESE.
Service is great and the resty is a VIBE.","Jason L.","I finally got around to dining here and I'm so glad I did! Since they're only open on the weekdays during lunch time, it makes dining here pretty inconvenient. Unless you work in the area or have the day off, coming out here might prove to be a little tough. If you do decide to come here, let me advise you to come at 10:30, 30 minutes before they open. You'd rather wait 30 minutes outside than possibly 1+ hours outside.
The menu rotates daily and they only have 3 pasta options. The day we went, they had pappardelle, orecchiette and torchiette. If you're unsure what type of pasta each one is, they have sample ones in front of the cash register so you can see. We decided to get one of each since it's such a pain to get out here. The portion sizes aren't too big since it's lunch time so I think two people can easily finish 3 orders. The pastas are delicious! They're all cooked perfectly al-dente and perfectly chewy. All three were amazing but I probably enjoyed the torchiette the best since it was the cheesiest of them all. Don't get me wrong though, they were all great!","Mia C.","For the price, portion, and quality of the pasta, iL Corvo is solid. However, I would not wait in line for over an hour to come here vs others in the area like Pasta Castalinga or Due Cucina, where there is no line. The pesto pasta and signature parpardelle were both good, and I love the olive oil they use here. Their open hours are only suited for people who are able to come at 10:45am, and even then it would be a 45 min wait before being able to eat. Not convenient. Good pasta.","Victoria C.","I've been so excited to come to this place due to all the hype around it. I might have come on a slightly off day though.
We came the day after Christmas around 10:45 AM, 15 minutes before they open. And they aren't kidding when they say if you don't want to wait that long to come around 10:30 AM to get in line. The line was long. And it might have been because a lot of people were off the day after Christmas, so why not come to get some delicious pasta.
You order once you get to the front, and the cashier will tell you where to sit. Like everyone else says, they do have a good system. They bring out pasta to you pretty fast, you eat, bus your own tables, and just get moving. There always seemed to be an open seat right when you got to the register. My husband and I got all 3 of the pastas, an order of the housemade focaccia bread, the kale salad, the proscuitto, and one of the dulche de leche cookies. The bread was the best part of the meal, although I do wish it was a little warmer. But I understand that they're trying to get it out orders as fast as possible. The kale salad was fine, as we the proscuitto.
When the pasta finally came out, we weren't blown away. To us, the base of the pasta dishes kind of all tasted the same. I was hoping the bolognese would be a little more flavorful, but it was just okay. They do have take out boxes for you to grab on your own as well.
For the line and wait, I probably wouldn't come back here. We didn't find the wait worth it honestly. The parking around the area is pretty scarce as well. There are some lots where you pay $10 an hour. Otherwise street parking is going to take you a little while to find.","Mandi W.","I stupidly came here at lunchtime... Whyyyyyyyyyy?!?!?!
1 hr 9 minutes later, we're finally seated. That line is deceiving though. You have your outside line... But once you get to the front you realize there's an inside line lol. Whyyyyyy?!?!
Anyways, once you make it to the front of the inside line, you order, find your seat, and staff will bring your food out. Once finished, bus your own table and be on your way.
Their pasta menu changes daily except for the pappardelle. We got that and the campanelli. Both had great flavor, and noodles were fresh and cooked perfectly al dente.
They'll seat you at any open table so you'll most likely be joining another party. Obviously parties of two are easiest here and it seemed most common.
Tldr: good pasta, long lines, not sure if it's worth that wait. I'll try again at an off time. Stay tuned.","Phil H.","Absolutely loved the whole experience here.
We were in town for a few days to explore Seattle before our Alaskan cruise and wanted to hit up a spot for lunch where the locals eat. II Corvo was highly recommended.
As advertised, there is a wait and the line can be long. We got on it and patiently waited. Moved decently overall and we got in after a while.
You head up to the main counter and place your order. Staff is very friendly and will find you a spot to eat, even if there is a small wait until other diners finish up. It's not the biggest place and it was packed while we were there. Was told this is pretty much the norm. Even so, they found our group of five a table within minutes.
The delicious house made pasta arrives fairly quickly. You grab your own napkins, utensils, water, and clean up after yourself once you're done. Each day they feature different pastas. At only $10 a plate it's super affordable. We each ordered different pastas to taste and share. Loved it.
Oh snap that focaccia bread. It's pretty awesome. It's the crack of carbs. Dipping oil too. The kale salad blew my socks off. I hate kale, as do most of my group, but we fought over this bowl and devoured it.
One of the best lunch experiences we had while on vacation.","Rebecca B.","I was visiting family for the holidays and waited in line on Christmas Eve for 40 minutes starting at 10:20am before opening and have no regrets. There was a line to the corner block by 10:30. My little brother, an aspiring chef, made me watch the Eater episode featuring Il Corvo the night before, but it didn't take much convincing to wait in the cold with him in order to be one of the first customers in the door.
We ordered a feast of the kale salad, focaccia, pappardelle bolognese (the staple signature dish), pasticcio, and wine. The menu changes and Il Corvo announces daily what three pasta dishes will be served that day. Tip: check Instagram for updates. You can't go wrong whatever you order. The kale salad had a delightful crunch with a lemon dressing and generously sprinkled cheese. The house focaccia is unlike any focaccia I've ever had. There is no way to accurately describe the doughy, chewy, fluffy goodness. The quality and ingredients is unlike any other. The pasta itself was everything the reviews said it would be. Each pasta dish is reasonably priced at just over $10. I'm convinced I won't find pasta like this anywhere near me in Colorado and I'll be waiting in line again during my next visit.
My only regret about Il Corvo is that it is a quite small restaurant. Since word of its superior pasta has spread, there is a line that extends from the front register where you order and pay and wraps out onto the block. You will likely share a table (family style) in order for Il Corvo to serve more customers. I think this is actually a fun family-like environment but others may find it stifling as people bustle next to you waiting in line as you try to enjoy your food. Nevertheless, the pasta is worth it.","Kathy M.","Our first day in Seattle as we were wandering around, we passed a long line of people waiting outside this tiny Italian restaurant. The weather was not great, so of course, I had to ask someone what was going on and WAS THIS LONG LINE WORTH THE WAIT.....I was told with an emphatic YES that this place was definitely worth a line and was given a brief summary of what to expect if we chose to try it out. We saved it for our last day on the hopes that a Monday might not be as busy as a Friday. Turns out, that this place is just busy! We arrived at 10:30 and took our place in line and our party of 8 walked out of this fine establishment at 12:40. Overall, everyone agreed that it was definitely worth the wait!! Their daily menu items are listed on a blackboard that you have more than enough time to read while you wait in line to order. In fact, because you are standing in line for the register in the middle of the 2 rows of tables, you also have ample opportunity to check out what the dishes look like as they are brought out to the other customers. This staff is amazing!!! They are friendly, efficient and seem to love where they work. No matter how improbable it seems, by the time you order and are looking for a place to sit, there is one available for you. Granted, everyone seems to understand that this is not the place to while away the hours and disregard all of the customers waiting in line.
Having said all of that, the food itself was wonderful. Fresh pastas, house focaccia and a kale salad that hubby has even mentioned to others because he feels it needs to be ordered (he is not a salad guy!). On our day, we sampled Pappardelle and Fusilli with rutabaga purée and loved both of them. I strongly believe that this kitchen knows what they are doing and you should trust their flavor combinations.
No matter how daunting the line looks, if you can make the time and are open to ordering what the chef has created, this place will not disappoint you!","Rachel Z.","I visited Seattle over Thanksgiving and decided to try Il Corvo after one of my friends raved about it. We arrived right at 11am on a Wednesday and the line was already around the corner! We ended up waiting around 1 hour and 15 minutes before we ordered our food at the counter. One thing that really stuck out to me was how reasonably priced the pasta was ($11 each). There are only 3 pasta entrees available to order each day. With a table of 3, we ordered 2 kale salads and one of each pasta offered that day: Pappardelle, Pasticcio, and Calamaretti.
The kale salad was really good. Not a surprise that almost everyone orders it. It's light and very refreshing. My favorite pasta was the Calamaretti, which had a really rich saffron and calamari broth. The Pasticcio was heavier and cheesy because it was baked in a pomodoro sauce. My least favorite was the Pappardelle because, despite the perfectly cooked pasta, the sauce was too dry.
Overall, I definitely think that the pasta at Il Corvo is great but I don't think I would wait in line again for over an hour to eat here. The atmosphere is also very hectic because there's a line of people through the middle of the restaurant. It's really crowded and because you have to bus your own table, it's a little bit of a headache navigating around the huge line of people when carrying dishes and glassware.","Jenny W.","The line is worth it!!! Simple menu so they can focus on making their 3 pastas the bomb! If you're visiting Seattle, I would put this on a must visit list. Consider it one of their tourist attractions. You really can't go wrong with any of the 3 pastas they offer. Since they rotate their pasta choices periodically, order all 3 and share, in case the next time you're there, the one you didn't try is off the menu at the time of your visit.","Lindsey S.","The famous Il Corvo is someplace that has been on my list of places to try out for a while, and so to be in between jobs, it gives me a lot of time to go out and explore. SInce Il Corvo is only open for lunch, I knew I had to go as soon as possible. I went at around 1PM on a weekday and was expecting a huge line and wait, but when I arrived, there were only about 4 people in front of me at the door. Of course inside, the line extends, but I stepped inside fairly quickly. The place does get very, very crowded, but what I loved is that you don't have people waiting around trying to fight for a table. Once you order, the person at the register will tell you where to sit. People seemed to come and go at a pace that was easy for everyone to get seated right after ordering. They have that system DOWN.
We ordered the pappardelle and conchiglinie pasta dishes, and started off with the house focaccia and prosciutto di parma. The two appetizers came out almost as soon as we sat down. The focaccia-AMAZING. A must. Then prosciutto di parma was also DELICIOUS, and I would definitely order both again. The olive oil on the prosciutto was so fragrant ! The noodle dishes honestly, were not the BEST I've ever had, and I felt that I might have had too high of expectations, but they were satisfying. For the pappardelle, it was a little too hearty for me. I like pasta sauce to have a hint of sweetness, and the sauce for this dish wasn't that tomatoey. The cochinglinie was very salty and spicy, and it was good at first, but became a bit overpowering at the end.
I say that I would recommend Il Corvo to those visiting Seattle, and that the wait is worth to just try it out, but in terms of homemade pasta, there are other places that have the same quality for an equal price. Very good, and I will be back to curb my curiosity of their other dishes.","Johnny Y.","I've been here twice with the most recent time being in Nov 2019. While Il Corvo serves really unique and delicious pasta dishes, I was extremely disappointed the last time I went because of certain cleanliness issues.
Food: I've tried the pappardelle and the calamaretti. The pappardelle was delicious with a nice balance of flavor between the sauce and the pasta. The pasta was al dente and cooked to perfection. The calamaretti was a tad bit salty for me but it had a rich seafood flavor. I really liked that it came with calamari as a topping for the pasta. The bread and olive oil was really the star of this place. I really enjoyed the soft fluffy bread with the oil.
Service and Cleanliness: We came around 12:30 and waited 2 hours to be served, but we expected the wait. The issue arose when we found a piece of hair in the calamaretti pasta. We showed the staff and they immediately got us a new plate quickly. However, we found another long piece of hair in the Kale salad. I'm disappointed that it happened twice and I hope they have higher hygiene standards in the future.
Price: Really worth it.
Overall, I wasn't the biggest fan after the second time. I like the dishes and the seasonal pasta offerings, but finding hair in the food definitely made me lose my appetite.","Mike N.","So the question is...Is it worth waiting in line in the rain for 30 minutes to get inside and wait another 20 minutes before you order? Yes! Small restaurant so you need to wait for tables to open before being seated but service is quick upon ordering. Menuu is limited to three lunch entrees. They always have the bolognese and two specials. $10.95 each. Pasta is homemade. Today was Lumache with celery root in a pepper cream sauce and Lasagna with chickpeas, kale and tomatoes in a bay cream sauce. Pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was not overpowering and did taste like red pepper. I'm a fan of vegetarian lasagna and loved this one. The blend of vegetables with the cheese was extraordinary. And yes, it was rich. We also ordered sides of focaccia (good-not too oily and perfect for dipping in sauce), kale salad (not a fan of Kale Salad but the dressing made this dish) and a Dulce de Leche shortbread cookie as we needed something sweet to complete the meal Total tab with tip for two was just over $40. You'll walk out needing to go the gym and saying, I'm coming back!","Toni L.","Word. Waited in a 45 min line with my sister on a Monday morning (around 11:45am). The line moved quickly and there are plenty of hungry visitors that are right in the same boat with you. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant is small and quaint, the line cuts through the middle and shared tables line the left and right sides of the restaurant.
You order everything at the counter and the chalkboard menu is revised daily, i heard. Dude taking the orders is super chill and patient despite the chaos of so many people bustling in and out. I saw many kale salads and a delicious looking caramel shortbread cookie on majority of the tables so we decided to get those. My sister also ordered the focaccia and then we each ordered our own pastas - i had a vegetarian one (sorry, forgot the name) and my sister ordered the bolognese pappardelle. Waters are self serve (there's wine available too) and then you are instructed on where to sit.
Love the homey, elbows touching, lively jazz vibes here. The food was absolutely worth the hype and wait. Pasta is perfectly firm and chewy and not to mention super affordable ($9.95 a plate). Sauces are simmered to perfection and i was blown away by the flavor on the kale salad as well as the rich intoxicating olive oil that came for dipping with the fresh baked crispy on the outside /fluffy on the inside focaccia.
Caramel cookie was also the perfect end to a hearty authentic Italian meal - shortbread was light and flaky and sandwiched in between was an amazing layer of soft caramel.
If you're on the fence i would 100% recommend giving it a shot. Also line seems to die down pretty dramatically around 2pm so if you don't mind a late lunch I'd say that's the way to go. PASTA FO LIFE","Tina Z.","We came on a Friday about 1 hour after the restaurant opened. I was absolutely amazed at the line that was already wrapping around the block and even contemplated on eating somewhere else.
We ended up waiting about an hour and 15 mins prior to order. To think I almost didn't try this place saddens me because what a one-of-a-kind this place is. We got their two daily specials as well as their kale salad. Both pastas were literally the most perfectly al dente pasta I have ever had- there is absolutely no doubt the lines are long!
This place opens only for 4 lunch hours 5 days a week. Each day, they make two to three pasta dishes with ingredients all different from the last (menu announced every day about 1-2 hours before opening on Instagram). Some dishes have ingredients I normally would not order in my pasta, but if Il Corvo made it, I would definitely try it.","Jennifer H.","If you're a pasta lover like me, you'll very much enjoy this little gem. Another fellow pasta lover brought me here and I was not disappointed.
There is always a line outside but it's there for a reason. It's the perfect lunch spot. I wish I could go every day just so that I don't miss a single dish they have to offer! Also love the fun antique decorations that gives the store so much character.
Their menu is updated daily with fresh ingredients. Unique handmade pasta with the most rich flavorful sauces! They also have other dishes besides pasta. I got their kale salad and it was delicious!","Lihan C.","I think hands down my favorite place I went to in Seattle. There is a huge line for this place, but I thought it was worth it. I ordered the classic Bolognese and the Fiore that they had that day, as well as the focaccia. The focaccia was very soft and airy and the olive oil tastes super great. The bolognese is very hearty with meat and is very gritty, but very flavorful and tastes great. The fiore was HANDS DOWN my favorite. It was just a little bit tart and resembled something like a vodka/lemon sauce (although I think it was a different sauce the name escapes me now) it was very pretty and kind of a light orange in color.
The pasta here is perfectly cooked al dente. I was seated at the long table with a lot of other people just going there to enjoy the food and 2 other people took up my lead and also ordered 2 or all of the pastas offered that day. We made friends and everything was great. A lovely experience and I would definitely do the wait again since it was WORTH.","Vee V.","Yep, there's a wait, yep the focaccia is amazing.
I arrived 30 minutes before closing so they were selling out of a couple items, it must have been their flavorful items cause we ended up with their pappardelle alla bolognese and orecchiette with pesto, it was just okay.
Once you order they tell you where to sit if you're dining in, the pasta comes fairly quickly. You grab your own water, napkins, utensils, and bus your own table once you're done.
The bread, yes, they ish is herbaceous, soft with a crunchy crust, and perfectly enhanced by the dipping oil. This was our favorite bite of the meal. The pastas were cooked well, but the pappardelle was way over salted, it was almost inedible. The orecchiette didn't knock my socks off, it was fine.
Factoring in the wait, this isn't a place I must come back to."
"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alex O.","Arancini Score: 3.5/5
Deep fried cheesy risotto served with light marinara sauce. Perfectly crispy. Has a nice crunch to it and has plenty of cheese pull!!! However, it was not very creamy and had a subtle taste. The added peas were a nice touch though
Gnocchi Score: 2.5/5
I was excited for this one but was let down. If you eat the gnocchi by itself the Gorgonzola cheese sauce is way too overpowering and goes straight to the nose. However, the flavor subsides when combined with walnuts.
Rigatoni Score 4/5
The pasta has a really nice bite to it. The sausage was on point and goes very well with the red peppers. I only wish that the red peppers were a lot smaller and not so daunting.
Lasagna Score 4.5/5
I have never had good home made lasagna and the best lasagna I have had is frozen. However, this knocks the frozen lasagna out of the park. It's a thin lasagna filled with a good balance of meat, cheese, and sauce. I especially like that the edges are nice and crispy.
Tiramisu Score 5/5
Omg this was so good. It was cool and refreshing. Filled with so much mascarpone cream. Coffee drenched lady fingers in between the layers and a chocolate top. I will get this again and devour it in less than 2 minutes. I gotta stop...","Kayla D.","A gem around the corner from everything! Delicious Italian food this place comes served with fine wines , kind staff, and excellent service!
Not only does it smell divine, your first bite tastes just as incredible! Came here for a business meeting a rec from the hotel.
Truly a delight !","Dave W.","Assagio was packed on this cold, wet, rainy, Seattle night. The place felt warm and inviting and our waiter could not have been any better. Really great service.
My wife had the linguini and clams. I had their saltimbocca. We both had ceasar salads. I'd give the pasta 4 stars and the saltimbocca a 3.5 star. A red blend wine from Montepulciano was fantastic.
The place has a vibrant atmosphere and is noisy in a good, Italian way. Definitely recommend!","Jessica S.","Bra. Vo. Round of applause for the waitstaff, hosts, chefs, and anyone else that I may have missed. This place hits the spot and doesn't miss a beat!
We made reservations day of using open table for a 5:45pm dinner. We were immediately greeted, checked in, and sat right away. We had a lovely table for two. This place is cozy and offers an intimate dining experience. I highly recommend this establishment for folks celebrating or just looking for a delicious authentic Italian dinner.
Food was top notch, after dinner coffee was a real treat, and the service was not a disappointment.
I can't wait to go back.","Toni Rose D.","My partner and I were craving pasta and we literally went to this restaurant because it was the closest to us. I'm glad we checked it out. We sat by the bar so that we could be seated immediately. The restaurant was pretty packed which is always a good sign. The bartender immediately served us with water. I ordered a glass of red blended wine to go with my pasta. I ended up ordering the pasta sampler with three different types of pasta: gnocchi, ravioli, and orecchiette. My partner ordered the rigatoni. The food came out right away. The serving for one pasta is a good size, but I thought that the sampler came in a smaller serving. The orecchiette was definitely my favorite although the other two weren't that bad. My partner loved the rigatoni. For dessert, we got the chocolate cheesecake and it was so rich. We were definitely stuffed. The service was on point!
Restrooms are separated between females and males.","Molly M.","Delish! The 3 pasta tasting was amazing. Gnocchi was bomb! Great atmosphere too for a fun night out.","Jan M.","We were in town for a long weekend, and our normal place, Tulio, was closed for renovations....so we needed to find a new Italian place to eat dinner. After doing a bit of research, this place seemed to be ideal, as it has a few fish dishes, some vegetarian dishes and looked quaint and cozy from the pictures.
Upon arrival, we were seated immediately (as we did have reservations). First impression overall was good - this place was busy and bustling with energy. I was excited to see several specials for the night, and three of them were fish! The wine list was also very extensive with Italian wines from all regions. We asked for a recommendation from our waiter, and we went with it. He was spot on with the wine - it was fantastic!
We started with bruschetta, which was fresh and not too garlicky, just the way I like it. My partner had the minestrone soup and said it was fantastic. For entree's, he had a basic pasta puttanesca and I ended up ordering the baked eggplant, even though the specials looked amazing.
Food arrived quickly, and I will say, the flavors were overall very good, but the eggplant was a bit odd. Usually this is served with eggplant cutlets, but I found that there was mostly the skin of the eggplant with very little of the vegetable middle (the meaty part), so it was a bit tough and not that enjoyable. I think I was just unlucky, but this is the reason I gave this place 4 stars versus 5. My partner really enjoyed his pasta.
Would I come back? Yes, but I still prefer Tulio and will return there next time I am in town.","Jen W.","20 years later, we visit again And have a very yummy dinner. And the Tiramisu!!!
we parked 2 blocks away in the Amazon building because it was free on the weekends...and saw there is free parking Across the street lol","MyAnne K.","My new favorite Italian Restaurant in the city! Assaggio nailed my favorite dish, ""Cioppino""! Full of flavors and packed with delicious fresh perfectly cooked seafood in a spicy light tomato based broth. Right on!!!! Wine list is great. We had a bottle of a spicy Sicilian wine. Dammmmmnn good!
Service on point. Both times I dined here, was nothing less than perfect.
The vibe in this restaurant is lovely, welcoming, and warm. I was able to reserve a table for 4 on a Thursday night. The place was packed! Full of families, couples, and business people. This place is for everyone. Cannot go wrong here. Love you Assagio!!","Caitlen S.","Super unimpressed... went here for a date night on vacation with my boyfriend, after being given suggestion by the concierge and looking at yelp. The only thing that was worthwhile here was the oil for the bread! We asked for a second basket, that's an extra charge and it came literally after we had finished our meal. Our entrees came out SO fast they must have been microwaved, but one of our meals was barely warm! Lastly, we attempted to experience the highly recommended zeppole - not worth anyone's time or effort. Both the pastry and dipping were hardly considered good.
I had high expectations for this restaurant, and am truly disappointed it didn't satisfy. It also didn't help that a group sitting somewhat near us who were friends with the staff were literally yelling and laughing so loud I couldn't hear anything my partner was saying without having to repeat myself in a loud voice. Several groups around us were giving the table looks, as it was an obvious annoyance.
When it came time to use the bathroom, one of the two toilets was majorly clogged with lots of toilet paper, and the other had globs of wet toilet paper on the back portion of the toilet. Either way, it was undesirable to want to use and a rather easy thing to fix, something necessary in a busy restaurant to maintain.
The ambiance was clearly not fulfilled given the attempts. I would not return the next time I'm in Seattle.","Nathan S.","I couldn't find parking and had to park 4-5 blocks away, so I was already grumpy by the time I got to my table.
Our seating was fine (next to front window), but I noticed that the dining area is a very cramped, almost claustrophobic space.
Anyway, our party ordered drinks. I asked what beers they had on tap. The waiter listed them and then asked if I was local. Weird question, to which I replied, ""Yes, and I'll take the Fremont.""
The drinks were fine. My beer was good and somebody ordered a well-made White Russian.
When the waiter returned, we ordered some appetizers. This process was difficult because after asking for recommendations, our waiter tried to up-sell us on a $50.00 main dish, claiming that we could split it three ways and wouldn't lose our appetite. Then when we asked for another recommendation, he said, ""The gnocchi is good...""
At this point, I'm thinking to myself, ""Wtf is wrong with this guy...that's another main dish."" I decided to end this awkward interaction and blurted out, ""We'll take some bruschetta.""
So, off he goes with our appetizer orders: one member of our party had ordered some type of shrimp or prawn appetizer and another had ordered what looked like deep-fried green olives.
Shortly, the appetizers arrived, minus my bruschetta. It was also at this point that we decided on dinner.
I ordered their margherita pizza, somebody else ordered their fish, and another guy ordered some pasta.
Long story short, their margherita was one of the worst neopolitan style pizzas I have ever had. I took a few bites and refused to eat anymore.
I tried a little bit of the fish dish and it was good, but can't comment on the pasta.
After that, I desperately wanted to leave, but unfortunately other members of our party decided to order dessert: cannolis and lemon sorbet.
The sorbet was a frozen travesty and barely edible and the miniature cannolis looked like tiny unappetizing weiners.
The total cost of this abysmal experience came to $188.00....even without the forgotten bruschetta.
I won't be returning to Assaggio and recommend that consumers choose somewhere else to dine.","Tiffany G.","We tried this place recently when reservations for Lola next door were full. I made reservations a few days before, this was our first visit here. We started with the caprese salad and well what can I say, it was basil, tomatoes and mozzarella. Pretty basic and rather underwhelming for $12. We both had the pasta sampler and I have to say my combination was quite delicious. Gnocchi, penne with pancetta and oriettcheta with beechers cheese. I would definately order that again. We split a dessert, a lemon sorbet of sorts. It was tasty but rather basic again. Service was prompt and courteous. Cute ambiance, overall a decent dinner. I'm giving it 4 stars because not sure it was worth the price tag. I would still rather have gone to Lola next door given the option.","Lawrence L.","We came here as part of a dinner tasting spree. With limited time in Seattle and too many good restaurants we wanted to try, we started getting single dishes at places. Here we got the Pasta Tasting dish and she loved it! I really liked it. The gnocchi, risotto and papardelle were great but the papardelle definitely took 1st place for both of us! The garlic for the bread was also amazing. I'd probably go back just for that!","David K.","Had a great dinner at Assaggio tonight! Clams and mussels, followed by Risotto with squid ink, halibut, prawns and who knows what else! Delicious! Fantastic Italian wines, espresso, Grappa and Limoncello to finish our meal! Amazing !
We have eaten probably 15 meals at Assaggio in the past 23 years. We have NEVER had a bad meal. I don't know where a bad review might come from since we've never had a bad experience.
Such a wonderful atmosphere, Mauro has always greeted us as if we are family. We hope to visit Italy with Mauro in the next few years! Felicidades!","Jessica G.","Super disappointing.
I took a new employee here (visiting from out of town) for dinner because of the good reviews, location, and ambience. Plus, I figured you can't really go wrong with Italian food, right?
WRONG! This place was disappointing on so many levels. I booked through Open Table, which actually went seamlessly. Got seated at a cute and quaint table right by the window, perfect for people watching. And then I noticed them...the fruit flies. EVERYWHERE. On the bread brought to the table. Floating around in the air. Lounging around on our table. Making themself at home on and in my wine. *shudders*
I spoke to the waitress and the hostess, and all they could say is that it was due to the cold weather. But, I eat out a lot this time of year and never experience this, and certainly not in a nice restaurant. I did get my glass of wine taken off the bill, but I could barely stomach eating my meal. I didn't see any fruit flies in my meal, but I'm sure had I let it sit there long enough, they would have made themselves right at home.
Sad. I love Italian food, and I was really hoping that this experience would be better and not so embarrassing for a new employee I had flown up for a work trip.","Eden A.","This restaurant was yummy but I'm not sure that it was quite worth the price. Some of the staff were curt and off putting, but our server Fabio was the sweetest guy. Would not go back, but not too sorry I went.","Sam S.","The atmosphere, service and food were top notch. My only complaints were that the table was too small and the chairs are very uncomfortable.
I recommend the brochetta and Chicken parm. Cappuccino was also good.","Corri M.","Fabulous Italian restaurant!
.
Ordered the meatballs as an appetizer. I had the penne alla vodka (requested shrimp instead of pancetta) & my husband had the chicken parmigiana. Zeppoles for dessert. OMG, everything was absolutely delicious!
.
Was visiting Seattle and this spot was recommended by a local. Definitely a winner. I do recommend making a reservation for dinner hours on the weekend.","Shreya K.","3.5 stars-- Was craving pasta for a while and wanted to try a new Italian place in the city so decided to give Assaggio a try. My boyfriend and I ordered the Gnocchi as well as the pasta tasting with Pappardelle and the Orechiette. My boyfriend loved the Gnocchi as he likes the strong flavor of Gorgonzola. It was a bit too strong of a flavor for me but I thought the other two pastas were very good. For $20, however, the portion size of the Gnocchi was extremely small. Another issue was the bread they served at the beginning was very cold. Not even room temp, but out of the fridge cold. We finished the meal with a tiramisu which was surprisingly pretty large! The dish itself was average-- nothing special really. Also, service was mediocre, the host wasn't super friendly and neither were servers. Overall, a pretty average experience.","Josef K.","Loud, but not too shabby. Sat at the bar for Happy Hour and had Brussels sprouts, meatballs, olives, and sausage pizza. It none of it was extraordinary. Just okay. If you're on 4th in Belltown and want something average and predictable, give it a shot."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mike V.","Why are these restaurants only in Seattle?
It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
What Zouave is for Italian with a hint of southern French flair, Pomodoro is for Italian with a decidedly Spanish/Mediterranean coastline lean.
The chef knocks it out of the park every time we go here, and the service in largely impeccable, but more so when the chef is hanging around your table.
Outside of traveling abroad, we rarely do a full bottle of wine at dinner in the US, as dinners are often so rushed. Not here. And we always take the chefs recommendation on a bottle once we've decided which of his incredible meals we will take on for the evening.
My personal favorites are the Capellini with the fresh dungeness crab (insanely good) and the puttanesca with prawns. And yes, you should absolutely take the chefs recommended additional spice from his special habanero olive oil that you've read about, or if you're lucky and he has it, his secret truffle oil.
We have two places we go every week or two in Seattle, Canon for drinks and dinner, and Pomodoro for the slightly early dinner on weekends, especially rainy ones where you want nothing more than comfort food, smiles and great red wine.","David P.","Honestly, I think Pomodoro is the best Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've been to fancier places in Seattle, to cheaper places, but the food and people at Pomodoro are second to none.
I used to live in Boston where I was lucky to have experienced authentic Italian food in the North End area of the city. Being able to get home-y Italian food is one of the things I miss the most about Boston and Pomodoro fills that void for me.
The food is no frills, just good food. The owners and staff are genuine and warm. We would highly recommend checking out Pomodoro!","Chris A.","A chef that's cooked for the King of Spain? Sign me up... xD
I've been living in Seattle for almost 10 years and Pomodoro continues to be one of my go to spots for visitors and for when I want to treat myself! Prices are very reasonable and the food and service is amazing.
Pomodoro is an awesome mixture of Spanish Basque and Italian. I've been numerous times, always ordered something new, and have always enjoyed my meal. Also can someone figure out what is in that avocado pesto that is brought to every table? Its so GOOD! xD.","Nicole A.","I was scrambling to find a place for dinner for 5 people on a Friday night, and luckily Pomodoro came the the rescue! It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen.
To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was sautéed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy.
For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty. I also enjoyed the seasonings and it was cooked well. The only suggestion I would have would be to get a bit more of a crispy layer in the skillet. The rice seemed like it was cooked into a larger batch and then served in the skillet they brought me, so I was missing the slightly crunchy and smoky bits I love in paella. After a while, the texture can be a bit one-note without them.","Thao N.","First of all, happy birthday to one of my best friend, Jordan!!!
She's the reason why we discovered this restaurant since I never have a reason to be around this Eastlake neighborhood. The restaurant is super cute, small, and intimate, good thing we had a reservation. Food is great, my angel hair pasta just melts in my mouth. I ordered no shrimp because I don't eat seafood and they offered to replace it with mushrooms, wasn't even expecting a replacement. Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xD
There's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out. Love this place, nice enough for date nights/special occasions and cozy enough if you casually just want some good Italian food for dinner. I hate cooking, good thing I didn't have to last night.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)","Jun Li Z.","Came here on a date in October 2018. The pasta dishes are great and I recall the service was really good. I recommend coming here on dates or with a friend. The atmosphere is quite chill, low lighting which can be romantic or hard for your partner to see the menu ;)","Zeena R.","The food was fine but the owner started arguing with some other guests about the freshness of the seafoood and that soured how much I enjoyed myself.","Jordan N.","I've been here two times already and both times have been amazing! They have free parking behind the restaurant and can make​ reservations online for big parties in advance.
Both times I ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara con Pancetta, which has pork belly and ​light cream. It was very delicious and satisfying to my stomach! Normally I feel so bloated after eating pasta but I ate the whole damn thing! I also had a malbec (red wine) to complement my pasta. There's also a bread appetizer served with some cilantro butter, so yummy!
Last night I came here for my birthday dinner and the staff brought out a tiramisu cake with a candle. The cake was rich in coffee flavor. The staff was also patient with our large party and even split up our checks and took a picture for us!
I love coming here and would love to try new things on their menu when I have another chance. Highly recommended to those who love Italian and Spanish dishes.","Jacqueline H.","Came here for a friend's birthday and had a great meal! The restaurant is in a quiet area of Eastlake and is pretty low key. The chef walks around and takes your order and provides some great recommendations. We ordered the portobello mushrooms and octopus as appetizers. Both were delicious! They also bring you bread that comes with a side of pesto - love when Italian restaurants give pesto instead of bread or olive oil!
For the entrees, we ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi, paella, and Capellini al Aglio con Polpa di Grancio e Tartufo. The paella was really good and came with a good variety of seafood (calamari, mussels, shrimp) and wasn't overly greasy. The capellini was delicious! I loved the crab meat and truffle oil. The gnocchi was good as well, but my least favorite out of the 3. Additionally we tried their tiramisu and it was amazing! Overall, a great Italian restaurant that is super low key but has delicious food. Highly recommend!","Gabrielle B.","Great spot for a special dinner with friends. The homemade oil is outstanding on top of the pasta.","Janhavi B.","Pomodoro is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Seattle. There are fancier ones, but the food and service here are is unparalleled. I would say that Pomodoro is pricier than some others (e.g. Ristorante Machiavelli) but it more than makes up with the personal touch and the fact that you can get a table way more easily! Located on the relatively quiet Eastlake Avenue - it's almost easy to miss, but their handmade pastas, and dessert (tiramisu and creme brulee) are a must-try. Almost every pasta and special I have tried so far has been delicious so I can't recommend anything specific but highlight recommend a visit here! With 1 entree per person, a dessert and a bottle of wine, it may end up costing you close to $40-50 a pop.","Lynden L.","My dining experience at Pomodoro was as a part of a large-party. For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time.
The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.
I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though!
The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine.","Raquel M.","Nope. Terrible food and subpar service. My expectations were perhaps unreasonably high given the website's description of the chef's experience. The bread provided as a starter was neither fresh nor toasted. It had the distinct preservative flavor of poor quality bread. The pesto served with the bread was cold and reminiscent of the flavor of grocery store pesto. Our server was more interested in high dollar tables where cocktails were ordered and it was difficult to get his attention. I had the pesto di pomodori secchi alla puttanesca and the anchovy smell and flavor overpowered everything else. I typically can't get enough pasta but could not finish this dish. My husband had the manicotti al forno and while it was good the walnut flavor was overpowering. The price of our meal was not commensurate with its quality. We've had cheaper meals that were tastier and higher quality. I wish we had skipped this place.","Jenny H.","FOOD: Ordered a few different pastas named as their ""popular dishes"" and they were all mediocre. 6/10
SERVICE: Good. Waitress came to check in frequently. Prompt. Courteous. 9/10
**Important to note. One big letdown for me and will be for all parents with babies/toddlers: NO HIGHCHAIRS PROVIDED HERE.","Amanda I.","I came to Pomodoro the night after an interview to reward myself and unwind a bit. I ordered the Dungeness crab angel hair pasta special and loved it. Though it was pricey, there was a good amount of crab. I believe it also had some black truffles which added great flavor to the simple butter garlic sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce to drizzle on top and I would highly recommend it. It is a bit spicy so maybe ask to try a little on the side first.
For dessert I got the creme brûlée. This is perhaps one of my favorite dessert dishes so I couldn't resist. I was somewhat disappointed. Instead of the creamy center it usually has, this one was much firmer. The flavor was good but the texture was certainly off. The top tasted like a toasted marshmallow which, again, is not quite what one typically looks for in a creme brûlée. But it was good and I ate it up. However for $9 it is definitely not worth the price.
Service here is really good. The owner is very friendly and chatted to me a little about my trip to Seattle. Other employees were very efficient and friendly as well. The check did feel a little rushed at the end but otherwise the service was great!
If you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion this would be a really good option. The food is a little pricier but it is delicious. The ambiance creates a more upscale feel and the service is on point.","Sloan C.","Went there last Friday night. Although I was late for my reservation, they were nice enough to find a table for me and my friend. Food was great. Ordered linguine with cream and anise sauce and shrimp. The sauce was balanced - flavorful yet not too heavy. The pasta was topped with some grapes, which I found interesting. I also ordered ab octopus side and it was soooo tender. Would definitely come back again to try other items from the menu!","Christina T.","My boyfriend and I came here for date night and it has become our favorite ""hidden gem"" that turned into an anniversary tradition. We love pasta.
Their restaurant is a small space and being that they're only open 5-11pm, I'd recommend going during the week.
Their bread and dip appetizer is to die for! It's light and fluffy and appetizers set you in for the rest of the meal to come. My boyfriend got the Linquine con Gamberie and I got the Penne Pasta alla Vodka. Delicious, delicious, delicious. If you like everything with a bit of spice like myself, just ask for their sauce! Someone will come by and give you a teaspoon full of their secret sauce.
Customer service is great. The intimate feel of the restaurant is amazing. It's a great place to dine!","Annalise W.","Love this place. Perfect little neighborhood Italian restaurant. Ideal for date nights, celebrating, or if you're just craving some delicious Italian food. Romantic, intimate, and homey vibe.
Portion sizes are generous and food is always consistently delicious. I love their caesar salad. I always get the same entree, the chicken breast with gorgonzola sauce and pasta with red sauce. It's absolutely amazing! Chicken is tender and juicy. I always have a hard time deciding if I want a creamy white sauce or a zesty tomato sauce and I love this dish because I get the best of both worlds. The chicken is covered in a creamy gorgonzola and the pasta is in a light tomato sauce. Portion size is very generous. They also have a house made chili oil that you can ask for on your pasta. It's too spicy for me, but if you love some heat I recommend. I have also ordered the carbonara, which I recommend. I also highly recommend the tiramisu.
Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city! There is also a free covered parking garage that is super convenient.","Alex O.","Best fettuccine Alfredo hands down. At least for me. I don't know why but it has such an interesting taste. Different from all the other Alfredo dishes I've had. I just want to eat more and more. It has a Spanish twist to it. If you order it's Polla al Jerez. The tiramisu is also heavenly. I need to stop trying the other desserts and just stick with this one.
The snow crab pasta is also exceptionally good. I need to get this one again. If only I could eat pasta everyday.","Artemis L.","I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.
My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.
I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said ""good"" (he says ""okay"" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too!
My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.
We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.
Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.
He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries).
He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.
At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.
However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, ""Is this gluten-free?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?"" He said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" I said, ""Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition."" He said again, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.
But then he said, ""well, your husband can eat it then."" I said, ""My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat."" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.
I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite the unsettling errors on his part.
Recommended, but if you are gluten-free maybe double-check more than you usually would. This food is absolutely stunning."
"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer H.","HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
Pasta Bella is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. Its a small hole in the wall. The space is tiny and there's always a wait for a table but totally worth it. Not only does the decor feel so cozy and authentic but also the food.
I've been here multiple times for many events and it truly never disappoints. The bread that is served is so divine with the olive oil and balsamic. They also have olive oil roasted garlic you can ask for on the side. The Penn Cove mussels is a great appetizer.
Every single pasta I have tried has been delicious. My all time favorite is the Fettuccine Marsala Fungi!!! Ugh best pasta ever. Their noodles are made to order.. always made and cooked perfectly. Also the Six Layer lasagna is a must try.
My mom loves pasta and is pretty hard to impress with food - as she is a cook herself. I took her here for her birthday and she absolutely loved it.
I would recommend making a reservation. Also make sure you get the deal on Yelp, $20 for $10!!","Jensen M.","It seemed like this restaurant still felt like a work in progress though the food was promising. It's relatively close to our house and there was a yelp coupon so we thought we would give it a try. The location is not in the downtown Ballard which I think is a perk as parking was ample.
The pasta was good but the service was slow. A single server takes all the orders of the restaurant, everyone else has dedicated roles too. Everyone was nice and the pricing was fair.","Sung S.","Food price was a bit pricy
Food itself was 3/5
The atmosphere is like going to someone home and felt a little crowded even though the place was pretty empty.
If the price was less expensive this would be a good place to eat.
Spaghetti was little watery
Halibut with pasta was good
Bruschetta was a bit overcooked where it was pretty much burnt but at least the flavor was good","Spat S.","Always great pasta here, if a little on the heavier side. Lasagna is peRfection! Love the huge menu and service is always good. Don't forget to try the desserts too. Feels like you can't go wrong here! Would recommend!","Nathan W.","Time: Saturday 8:30pm
Service: 3/5 They seem a bit understaffed because the place wasn't even half full but it took about 15 minutes for a party of 2 to get seated even though it was past peak dinner time... Once we got seated, the waitresses were very friendly though and made sure we got our bread, water, and orders taken.
Ambiance: 4/5 2 main dining rooms with a bunch of Mona Lisa paintings and old pictures/paintings on the wall. It's a little dim inside and I'm not a big fan of the color scheme and decorations. Not the most visually appealing.
Parking: 4/5 Free parking in the lot next to the restaurant. Parking lot is a bit small, but there is also free parking on the surrounding streets.
Food: 5/5 I ordered the Penne Salsiccia Gorgonzola ($18) and my friend got the Linguini Carbonara with Sausage ($17 + $4). This is probably the best Italian place I have had so far in Seattle. Both pastas had amazing texture and the sauces were very tasty without being too heavy. Portions were also very big. The pancetta was a little salty, but that's ok. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Italian pasta. I will definitely be returning to try their other pastas. I have also heard the dessert is amazing. Prices are a little on the higher side, but the food is so good that it's definitely worth it!
Overall: 3*0.1 + 4*0.1 + 4*0.1 + 5*0.7 = 4.6","Mackenzie C.","Super cute, casual restaurant. We started with the gnocchi pomodoro and it was so fresh and the sauce was amazing. For my main dish, I had the Capellini Gamberi Alfredo and it was so so yummy. My boyfriend had the chicken risotto which he enjoyed. The portions were huge - we both took food home, which is surprising as normally when we go out my boyfriend finishes his meal and whatever is left of mine. Really great spot for a casual, but still amazing, dinner.","Nancy N.","This place was amazing!!!! Luckily we made a reservation through the yelp app an hour prior because it's a smaller, cozy restaurant for sure. A handful of people waiting who didn't make reservations when we got there but they still got seated within 20 mins. Ordered a ton of food including mussel appetizers, two bottles of wine, fettuccine, lasagna, and much more. Everything was extremely yummy.
Our waitress was the sweetest and one of our dishes was taking longer to come out, so she gave us a complimentary dessert. Also amazing
Overall 5/5. Can't help that there's a wait for yummy restaurants, so make sure you make a reservation.","Aline R.","I had reservations for the restaurant of Christmas Eve. Did it through their own website, got a confirmation email and went with my life. The day of I called them to confirm and nobody picked it up, SUPER RED FLAG. When me and my husband got there the place was closed. Just that, we ended up scrambling around to find another restaurant since all place open we're operating on reservations and we didn't have one. While we're walking around Ballard Ave to find a new place we heard of people who also had the same problem. So disappointed with this place.","Ellie Sam R.","We had no reservation and they were packed but the wait wasn't long. Thank you for putting up with our fussy little eater and not being snobbish about our shared portions. Have it down for a solo date on our anniversary and for special family occasions.","Dan C.","We walked in on a Saturday night and waited only 30 minutes. The service was amazing, the servers, hostes, busser, manager, everyone was so kind. This is the perfect place for a nice date or any occasion. The food was some of the best Italian food I've had in Seattle. I highly suggest eating here! You won't be disappointed, especially if you cherish service that exceeds expectations.
We will definitely be back soon!!","Adam S.","Easily the best Italian Food I have had in Seattle to date. I'm sad it took me two years to find this gem but so happy that I finally did.
I went with my parents and we were able to order a good bit of food (super reasonably priced) to try.
Every dish tasted fresh and packed with flavor. Definitely did not skimp on the portion sizes as well.
We also got the calamari as an app (sautéed not fried) with olives and tomatoes - it was out of this world.
Go here. Eat here. Come back again and again!","Crystel T.","*UPDATE (12/28/18)*
Update from my original post - I ordered the Gnocchi again and sadly, it was not cooked. If you look at the picture I posted, you'll see the undercooked dough. Also, the pomodoro sauce was very sweet this time around. Hated to throw away a $10 appetizer.","Zacarias D.","I decided to try out Pasta Bella for dinner on this Sunday night because I have driven past the restaurant a million times in Ballard and I'm glad I came to try it out.
The scenery of the restaurant is very old fashioned Italian feel. The hostess greets you with a wine menu. All of the pasta's and dishes are very authentic. I had a great spicy wine sauce linguine pasta and the noodles were Al dente! With my pasta I had a glass of Pinot Grigio that went perfect with the pasta.
For dessert I had the TiraMisu which was delicious chocolate had a coffee taste and was moist. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for authentic pasta. This would be a great place to celebrate a birthday or anniverary with your loved one or even just a date. I will be back for a special occasion","Viraj H.","Pasta Bella is a cute little italian restaurant in Ballard. It's a great alternative to the upscale italian restaurants you generally find, and has an old school charm to it.
The restaurant feels like you're walking into a house. They have two separate rooms/sections, both pretty identical. The decor isn't very fancy, but rather cozy and homely, and the ambiance is pretty quiet. Great low-key date place.
Though the place is pretty large, most of their tables seat four, so a large group may not be the best here.
The food was delicious. We tried four different pastas, and they were very good. I specially liked their raviolis.
We got a half bottle of wine, but surprisingly it was served in a carafe, not in a bottle. I wasn't very happy of how it was served, and would have preferred some clarity on that upfront.
The service, though mostly fine, seemed lacking in warmth. Our original server was very friendly and helpful, but the manager/owner? lady seemed very cold and rude. They kept switching servers on us, and the lady seemed annoyed with our requests for water refills. They forgot our soup (and didn't charge for it as well), which was pretty surprising, but not a big deal.
The prices are at par with the competition, sort of on the higher side for a comparable restaurant.
Overall, it's a cool place worth going to occasionally. Not my favorite italian restaurant, but not bad either. Would recommend!","Raj S.","This is one good Italian restaurant we've been to. The ravioli and gnocchi were amazing! Minestrone soup personally didn't like it much. But my friends loved it.
Note: Make sure to call before you go. They weren't accepting walk-ins until 8:30pm when we visited.","Chloe Z.","Booked a reservation on Yelp weeks ago for tonight at 6:00pm (Christmas Eve) and boyfriend and I walked all the way there in the cold to discover it was closed. Massively disappointed and ended up walking to our backup reservation that I'd cancelled in favor of Pasta Bella. I'm sure they must've received some sort of notice when I made the rezzie, why not tell me they wouldn't be open?!?!","Megan R.","Small local joint, reasonably priced, large portions, tasty dishes and super friendly service. Is it the best ever probably not but to have a good experience all around, I'm happy and will frequent regularly. $10 off if you check in with purchase of 2 entrees.","T R.","Had Christmas Eve reservations at 5:30pm for four but the restaurant was not open. Two other parties showed up for their dinner reservations while we were there and also went away hungry. Some very unhappy people in that parking lot. Funny that PastaBella could not take the time to reach out and cancel the reservations; not even an explanatory sign on the door! It will be a distant day before we give them another chance.
BTW, I emailed Mike@PastaBella with news of the reservation issues and never even received the courtesy of a reply. Very poor form.","Marco M.","This meal was a disaster. The food was about 3 stars but the service was so awful I'd give zero stars if possible.
My wife and I are on vacation in Seattle with another couple. They took us out the previous night so we wanted to treat them to a nice meal tonight. Since our last vacation together was in Rome I thought Italian food would be a good choice.
I made a reservation for 4 through Yelp and we arrived right at 7:30. We were greeted and seated promptly. A few minutes later our server brought water, warm bread and olive oil. So far, so good.
We ordered appetizers and entrees. We drank water, asked for refills as it was a hot day and the restaurant did not have air conditioning. We asked for more bread. 45-60 minutes went by with no food. My wife asked the host and she explained that they were short staffed. She said to let her know if there was anything she could do. There seemed to be four tables occupied so it wasn't crowded but I think there was only one cook. It would have been nice if we had been warned there would be a very long wait for food BEFORE we were seated, or at the very least, before we ordered. We shouldn't have had to ask where our food was. Also, they could have offered complimentary drinks at that point.
The appetizers came soon after our inquiry. My wife and one guest enjoyed the shrimp pesto appetizer. We also had the special sun-dried tomato pistachio crostini. Two of us liked it, two did not. We also had the gnocchi in creamy tomato sauce which was ok. And I had the Caesar that was also just ok.
Then we waited. And waited and waited. The host cleared the appetizer dishes and asked if we wanted dessert menus. We explained that we were still waiting for our entrees. Perhaps she was embarrassed, who knows, but from that moment on she became rude and unpleasant - details to follow.
Our entrees finally arrived a full 90 minutes after we were seated. One guest and I split the puttanesca and a vegetarian version of the gnocchi. My wife and other guest shared Halibut with citrus sauce and linguini Amatriciana. All of the pasta was over cooked. The puttanesca sauce was fine. The gnocchi was ok. My wife liked the halibut but our friend didn't care for it. By the time the food arrived we were rather irritated.
The waiter said he would comp dessert and drinks. He cleared the table while my wife was still eating and even brought dessert menus before she had finished her meal. Only two of us wanted dessert and three coffees. They tried to get cappuccino or espresso but the waiter said the machine was broken. RIGHT. Then they asked for plain coffee. He said that since they closed at nine it was too late to make it. I pushed back saying it wasn't our fault that we waited an hour an a half to be served entrees. He acquiesced and brought out two decafs. The host brought out the two desserts and practically slammed them down on the table. Then the coffees and one tea arrived. She brought out a handful of little tiny portions of half and half and flung them onto the table. All of this with no eye contact or one word from her. After she left we had to laugh because her behavior was so ridiculous.
Then we waited and waited for the bill. We finally were getting up to leave to pay at the register when the bill came. At that point the host said some pleasantry as if she hadn't been awful for the past several interchanges.
I usually tip 20% or more on the entire bill but I only left $10 which was 10% of the pretax bill. In retrospect, I should have left nothing. The waiter wasn't rude, he just didn't let us know there would be serious issues in getting our food and then made a grand gesture of comping things he didn't have or wasn't willing to make.
Mediocre food and horrible service. We have another week in town and you can be sure we will not return here.","Julie R.","Delicious dinner. Bread course includes garlic confit under oil. So rad. Generous portions fed my teenage boys impressively. Great service, attentive, charming and authentic. Love it!"
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","John W.","What a nice find, downtown Seattle -
I wish local-to-me Italian restaurants could pull off the kind of affordable home-made Italian that this place does, right in downtown Seattle, no less.
If I was local, I'd be coming here quite often - I don't know how they make Italian this low of price, and this high of quality. I would have expected to pay more. Heck, in my town, homemade Italian of any kind is starting at over $20 a plate.
This place is comparable in price to Old Spaghetti Factory and Olive Garden (but obviously is worlds better).","Danielle D.","TLDR
I'm Italian and from NY--my standards for Italian food are high.
Seattle has a way of taking any type of soul food & making it unapproachable, so when searching through all of the restaurants I was reluctant.
I was given a few Italian restaurant suggestions, but they all were an abrupt ""no"". Through my own search, I found Machievelli. I was hesitant at first--bc yelp photos make it seem like a pizza shop--but
Took a chance.
I was blown away.
There are TWO rooms, a bar area /waiting room and a romantically lit dining room.
Tiny, but the feel and smell brought back NY memories.
I was seated with bread. Thank goodness. Put away 3 plates myself.
Gave them additional tests & ordered the traditional antipast, eggplant parm, & tiramisu.
WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!
They are a restaurant I will forever go to --and send people to!
Bring cash trust me.
Oh man I loved this restaurant.","Prag R.","Incredibly LONG wait time. We waited for 2 hours to get a table last night. Wish they accepted phone reservations, wonder how this never bothered them as many Yelpers have given the same feedback!
FOOD-
While waiting for the table, we hung around the bar and ordered few drinks and small plates. They were okay. We ordered the main course as soon as we got seated. The bread was good, soft and fresh. Its free for the first time and you pay on from the second order. We got the Spinach Ravioli and my Veal Saltimbocca and they both were so yummy! Worth the wait time definitely.","Khanh N.","I am sooo glad I found this cute little place! Shoutout to my boyfriend for finding it on his Yelp search!
This cute little place was packed when we got there around 8pm on a Friday night. We put or name down (they quoted as an hour) and went elsewhere for a drink because the bar area was packed as well. The layout of the restaurant is a bit odd and a little difficult to get in and out with people wait on the bench but I think it adds to its charm. Just be prepared to wait but there are tons of places around to grab a drink or explore :)
We came back an hour later. And they called two names that didn't show and then we were up! They quoted us time perfectly. Going into the restaurant area you can see why it's such a long wait. I think I counted about 14 tables for the entire restaurant.
We sat down. Got bread. We ordered drinks. Drinks came so fast. We got a half carafe of red wine. And then we ordered. And our food came. It was such fast and great service! We felt cared for but also didn't feel like they were bothering us all the time. The bread is from Macrina bakery and it was delish! Our pastas that we got were UNREAL. Such good portions sizes and DELICIOUS.
Best part of this was that it was $44 before tip and we were stuffed and had leftovers. That's definitely a STEAL!!
Probably are new go to date night spot. Seriously love this place.","Nancy W.","I haven't been here for a few years but still love the place. Very small venue and they don't take reservations so either get there early or plan on a wait. We were here on a Friday night and got to the restaurant about 5:15 and they were just about full, even after opening at 5. As an appetizer we ordered the Bresaola Alla Valtinellese which is cured beef, olive oil and lemon topped with arugula and shaved parmesan cheese. My friend ordered the fettuccine carbonara and I ordered the lasagna bolognese. Both were excellent, although I would have liked to have had more bolognese sauce. Noticed that in between some of the layers of lasagna there was nothing but pasta on top of pasta. Wine was nothing exceptional. Didn't order dessert but now wish I had as they featured a chocolate mousse tiramisu. Big regret there. Small cozy bar with good music.","Tom B.","I've eaten here 18 years now. Moved away, but every time I come back to Seattle, this is a must. Cozy and delicious. Chicken Piccata
fresh lemon, capers, sweet butter - my personal favourite with a side of spaghetti. Oh man. I need to get back up there! Well done you.","Carol B.","Honestly, how can you not love this place. It's the perfect place for authentic Italian food and it's so cheap! We've tried so many different dishes here and love each and every one. If I had to make one recommendation, it would be to try the linguine and clams. Don't forget a wine pairing!
Full warning, there's essentially no parking in this area of capitol hill so you should walk or take a ride share. There's almost always a wait, so plan accordingly. The inside is quite small which means it gets loud quickly, but again it's all worth it. We can't stay away","Jenny C.","It has been a long time since I've been here and on a Friday night there was about a 45 minute wait. The good thing about their waitlist is, if you miss your spot they'll put you in line for the next table so it is not like you have to wait all over again.
I don't really enjoy the atmosphere of this place and that's the main reason for me not coming back. It's crowded and loud and not in the least bit romantic if you're looking to come here for a date. That being said, I did enjoy the food. The Caesar salad had a good dressing and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. I loved my linguine vongole and that was definitely the better of the two pasta dishes but I think I would be smart and just get takeout next time.
There is a 5% cash discount so bring some cash if you would like to save a little money.","Dione L.","Me and my boyfriend always walk by this restaurant and have been dying to go. We finally made it over here and literally probably MY FAVORITE italian spot in seattle.
The staff/ service was fantastic. The restaurant was super cozy and fun. The food is super reasonable and portions were good.
The pasta was super fresh i got the spaghetti with garlic and olive oil. Super light and good flavors. I'm going to have dreams about this pasta no joke!
10/10 come","Janhavi B.","My new go-to for a casual Italian dine-out experience. Authentic, delicious and not unnecessarily expensive (unlike most Italian joints in town). We were 3 people and shared the red pepper penne with shrimp, the carbonara and a half-carafe of wine! We ended up paying about $25 a pop. You can expect a long wait given its location in Capitol Hill but you can wait with a drink in the bar area and should get in within 30- 45 minutes. All in all - highly recommend for an amazing Italian fare!","Michael G.","Trattoria atmosphere, large menu, passable service in a very busy location. Tight tables make for a loud atmosphere.
Extensive menu. We had the eggplant and tortellini with creme sauce, both were spot on. There are so many Italian joints in this general area, this is a good choice for the price. Carafe wine was decent.
We will return.","Victoria H.","Machiavelli was amazing! It is truly a little Italian treasure on Capitol Hill! I have lived in the neighborhood for a while, but recently decided to try it out and so glad I did!
The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five was the LONG wait. Otherwise, it's a fantastic restaurant! The servers and hostess were all really nice and the food is DELICIOUS. It was definitely some of the greatest Italian food that I have had in Seattle! I really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant as well. Very hip and casual.
Myself and my friend both had the Chicken Parmigiana and we loved it! It was cooked to perfection and had a layer of sauce over it that was amazing! The cheese melted on top was delicious as well, and to top it off the ground parmesan cheese on top of it made it everything! The spaghetti that came as a sodr dish was delicious as well!
For dessert, I had their in-house made vanilla bean cheesecake, which was phenomenal. It had a Graham cracker crust that just melts in your mouth. One of the best tasting cheesecakes I have ever had!
I definitely enjoyed Machiavelli and I will be returning. :) Please note, if you go on a weekend night, please be prepared to wait a while. However, your wait will be worth it! :)","Nita L.","TLDR: Amazing food, cheap prices, ridiculously long wait times for both food and a table.
Food: You get a free serving of bread for the table which was fresh and soft, also much needed because the wait for food was really long. We ordered a half carafe of the house wine to drink, the spinach ravioli - which was creamy and well cooked and my ultimate favorite- The chicken liver lasagne. The chicken liver lasagne takes 25 mins to cook and every bite of it is well worth the wait.
Ambience & Service: This is a cozy restaurant with limited seating so the wait times here are incredibly long. I had to wait for more than an hour to get a table for 2. They don't accept phone reservations either. You can chill at the bar while you wait.
Cost: This is where this restaurant won me over. Cost us just 46$ for a dinner for two people that included 2 glasses of wine per person and 2 entrees. This is a very decent price to pay for the quality of food you get here.
My only complaint is the wait times involved. Else this place is awesome!","Jenn N.","We had to wait 1hr, but the food was really worth it.
The Caesar salad with white anchovies was EXCELLENT. Probably the best salad I've ever had, thought it may or may not have been caused by the 1hr wait time. Anyway, the white anchovy add on is a must.
For the main course, I got the chicken liver lasagna. It was delicious, but I also like eating organs (fair warning for those who don't like eating organs normally and want to see if they'd like it. You won't because the distinct flavor was definitely still there).","Elizabeth K.","I absolutely loved my meal here! I was in the mood for a more basic pasta dish, something like plain spaghetti with marinara, and Machiavelli offered that. However, I was delighted to end up enjoying the red pepper pasta. It was creamy and full of flavor - perhaps the best pasta I've ever had. After my first bite, I thought, ""can I come here again tomorrow?"" I also got the mixed greens salad, which was served with a great dressing.
The restaurant was busy, but the wait staff was attentive and friendly. One of the staff members took some photos of a group that had finished dining, even though the restaurant was pretty busy. I thought that was kind.","Pinky P.","This place was recommended to us by family who lives close by. And thank heaven they did! When we first walked in, I was scared we wouldn't get a table. Always a good sign in my book when a restaurant is packed but even a better sign when it's a random Tuesday night!
The service was incredible from the minute we walked in. Everyone was so friendly.
We ordered the chicken parmigiana and the spinach ravioli. The ravioli was delicious and they didn't skimp on the tomato cream sauce. Pretty delicious. The chicken parmigiana blew our minds! We both decided it was by far THE BEST we have ever had! The sauce was so perfect and the chicken portion was perfect. Usually it's too thick and you loose the flavors eating the chicken.
Last we had the chocolate mousse tiramisu. It was also good. I preferred the moose over the rum dipped lady fingers.
The only slight improvement would be the bread in the beginning (which was complimentary). It was really hard and chewy but really does not matter with everything else being so amazing! Go eat the chicken parm here! You won't regret it!","Sou M.","My friend was craving carbs a few nights ago and she loves italian, so we looked this place up and decided to go.
When we got there, there was a 30-40 mins wait time (on a Tuesday). We were waiting at the bar area and asked the server if we can just order food or appetizers at the bar and she said we can do that. The bartender, however, denied to take our food order or even showing us the menu!
After finally getting the table, we ordered an eggplant parmesan and a penne pasta with red pepper and walnut. They served complementary olive bread with a mix of olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette which we loved!
The eggplant parmesan was just ok, it was too cheesy and not as breaded as we like. The pasta was really good and creamy.
The server was nice and attentive. The ambience is old and cosy, with dim lighting. The wait time for food was long. The value for price is good since the portions are big.","Srikanth T.","Two things came to mind when I walked into this place. 1 - it smelled amazing. Maybe it's just bc the rest of cap hill smells like weed, but it was a welcome change of pace as far as smell goes. 2 - Machiavelli was the Italian you chose to go with? There were no other Italians that came to mind, you went with the guy who invented political scheming? I mean fine, I guess, but Ristorante Machiavelli reads like a name that some B level director would name the restaurant that the mob owns in his/her B level gangster movie. Anyways, I was waiting at the bar for 15 min and decided to grab the house red wine. The wine was decent but they poured it in this tiny ass cup, I felt like I was Kahwi Leonard palming a basketball drinking out of it. Surely you have real wine cups, Italian Restaurant. Anyways after we were seated we got served bread pretty quickly - rather than the usual olive oil and pepper to dip, they went with an olive oil and balsamic vinagrette combo, I was not a fan personally, it was more tangy than I would've liked. At this point you're reading this (wow, you're still reading this!) and wondering how I could possibly give this restaurant a 4. Well here's the good - the service was really good, the waitress was really friendly and the food came out super fast. I ordered the chicken Milanese and it was pretty decent. It was a little on the lemony side but the chicken was cooked well. I can't expect the same quality of New York Italian places but it was solid. The spaghetti wasn't perfectly al dente, but it also wasn't like barilla pasta. And it was only about 20 bones for an entree and a red wine. I wouldn't take an out of towner here, but it's not too bad.
3.5 star Sriview, truthfully it's a 3.5 not a 4, but I'll round up cause I do appreciate good fast service.","Richard S.","Top 10 dining experiences we have ever had. Never would have found this place if not for the recommendation of a bartender in downtown Seattle. Just goes to show you. Talk to your bartender. They know stuff.
It's in the Capital Hill area in a quaint little corner building with a homey comfortable feel. There is a small bar area in case there is a wait or you need a liquid appetizer. Wine list was adequate and plenty
Of cocktail and beer options.
I'm not sure if the bread was complimentary or if there was a cost but regardless it was completely necessary and appreciated. Half of the bread that I'm sure was a sourdough had green olives baked right in (see pic). And to gild the lily they offer a calamata olive tapenade with anchovies and mozzarella that will blow your mind. Salt on salt on love.
Chicken Piccata in a butter and caper sauce = 11 out of 10. Gnocchi al Sugo = same. Service = above and beyond. So good we didn't stop to take a pic.
Go to here.","Edward S.","This is a classic Italian restaurant like you might find in NYC, Chicago, or Boston (and they have been in Capitol Hill since 1988 which is very impressive).
I ate at the bar, which is small but has great service. I ordered a half carafe of the house red, which was really good for the price. They also give a basket of olive bread which is outstanding (they offer to sell second basket and I could see doing that if I were eating with another).
I originally ordered the lasagna, but since the bartender said it might take half an hour I switched to the Conchiglie della Casa (pasta shells with sausage and marinara). I was not disappointed with the switch. It was served really fast and was delicious. The pasta was nice and fresh, the sausage had just the right amount of spice, and the sauce was perfect.
I will definitely be back."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","Rebecca W.","This place has serious date night vibes with the dimmed romantic lighting and with their awesome happy hour you can do date night on a budget! I came to celebrate my friend's birthday recently and the whole experience was amazing! The hostess was super nice and made an exception by letting my two friends sit in the bar area (HH area) before I got there (usually the whole party has to be there). The food tasted amazing at only $12 a plate on the happy hour menu it's a steal!!! They also didn't skimp on the size like I expected for HH and instead the plates were full dinner size. The drink prices were also pretty good with $6 for a well drink and $$4 for a San Juan hard seltzer.
I ordered the spaghetti with chicken ricotta meatballs and I'd give it a 4/5 stars. You can definitely tell the pasta was homemade from the great texture and the sauce was light, but well flavored. I liked the meatballs, but I wish you could taste the ricotta more and that they did 3 slightly smaller meatballs instead of 2 massive ones. I'd definitely order this again! My friend had the Pappardelle and from the one bite I tried I it also tasted really good!
I'm definitely coming back and I highly recommend this place for happy hour (5-7pm)! I might even come back and try the full dinner menu. Thanks for the quality food/drink and I can't wait to come back!","Zachary H.","My gf and I went here for our anniversary.
We were hoping to get the happy hour deals but the bar was full so we sat at a table. It's a bit annoying that the happy hour is only offered at the bar and not at the tables. If I sat 3 feet away from my table seat my dinner would've been deeply discounted for the same food. Oh well.
Upon being seated, the waiter gave us each a small glass of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary. That was a kind gesture and was appreciated. We ordered some drinks and our meals and waited in anticipation. I ordered the pappardelle and my gf got a carbonara dish. The food was stellar. When it arrived at the table it was one of those dishes that doesn't look like a lot of food until you start eating it. We also ordered the bruschetta with smoked salmon. It was tasty but I'd probably try another appetizer next time.
The service was exceptional and food was awesome. I hope to return at some point and hopefully get a spot at the bar for happy hour!","Kamara S.","Out of all the Italian restaurants I visited in Seattle, I have to say Tavolàta is one of my faves.
I have been to both restaurants multiple times. In fact, once I came an hour early because I thought it opened at an earlier time. Of course, I couldn't show my face for a period of time after that.
This review is for the Belltown location. The people there are friendly as you walked through the door and explain to you that happy hour (5-7 pm) is limited to the long bar in the front and the side table structure at the very front of the restaurant. I say structure because it glides along the window in a weird pattern that is aesthetically interesting to see.
I have to say this restaurant has a great happy hour. I define a good happy hour as one where you could get a decent meal just off of ordering from the happy hour listings alone. You can get cheap but delicious wine options ($6 bubbles don't mind if I do). Good apps to share (if you are into that). Plus actual pasta options like 2 different dishes of spaghetti depending on your interest. Plus I appreciate that they have an actual dessert on the happy hour menu as well.
Myself, like many others before me, have chosen the gnocchi alla romana thinking it would be the small ones we know. I won't call it a mistake because I enjoyed the dish, but I think they can call it out more so people know what to expect.
But the main reason I go back to this restaurant, even if I have to cross from the Eastside is for something that isn't even on the menu and isn't available all the time. It is... their bucatini carbonara. I know this is not the first place I had bucatini but it is a good reason why I love it. It is not even available during happy hour but I keep going back for it (I try other good things as well).
The worst part is the guessing game in which you have to see it if it would be available. I could call ahead to check but even I am not that ridiculous and I can try other dishes when I get there. I have been there once where they were going to have it the day after I ate there. I was crushed. But it is a great #treatyourself meal if it is available.
Would I bring a big group to Tavolàta? Not in the winter if you are banking on happy hour. But if we wanted to ball on pasta and other treats, sure. If it was 2-3 people, I would definitely try to get a bar seat. It would be a great and interesting date location.
This was my first Ethan Stowell restaurant when I came to Seattle and it has inspired me to go to more","Heather W.","Highly recommend the Pappardelle! Was delicious.
Burrata app, not so much. Their menu changes but it seems they keep different versions of it - when we order it there were figs. Issues were the oddity of the ice cold cheese and rock hard crustinis that are a bit painful to bite into. After enduring for a bit, I decided to ask our server for some fresh bread and that switch helped a bit. If the crustini was a bit thicker cut and more chewy than hard, it would help a lot.
Got 'An appropriate sipper' (bourbon based cocktail) and that was very tasty and enjoyed.
Our table was towards the back along the wall with view into the open kitchen. I always enjoy watching the kitchen prepare meals. Great advertising on their part since it convinced us to get the delicious dessert that was being prepared for a large group. I forgot to take a photo and my memory is fuzzy but since these items change often there isnt much point!
I do appreciate the constantly changing menu; I'm sure this is a popular spot for locals of Seattle. Lovely ambiance, attentive service, delicious italian food.","Madison S.","This is my second time to a Tavolàta restaurant. The pasta is pretty dang good. The atmosphere is delightful (think candle light, rustic modern brick, open kitchen). It is rather loud in the restaurant. Can we tough to find good parking, so we paid to park in a lot behind the restaurant. The starter bread was good (not out of this world). The spaghetti dish was really good - noodles were thick and delicious and the sauce was light and yummy. The Pappardelle was good - heavy sauce, orange flavor didn't throw me off a ton, and thick noodles. I preferred the spaghetti dish however because the noodles and sauce were better IMO. The chicken and ricotta meatballs were also very good with the spaghetti. Portions are large - we both took some to go. Price is high.
As a local. I don't think it was worth going again for the price overall, but a nice dining experience for a date night.","Tara D.","Food was phenomenal! The duck was amazing, especially the finishing sear. The risotto was creamy and flavorf. Even the starters were great! We ordered the brussel sprouts and squash as well as the bread, and oil and vinegar. Beautiful flavors in everything! I would be happy to come back.","David H.","I really enjoyed having dinner for Seattle Restaurant Week here because they allow you to order anything off of their menu, while most restaurants have a limited menu.
For appetizers, I loved the bruschetta. It was well cooked and the smoked fish was perfect on top. This was probably the only appetizer I enjoyed.
For entrees, we had the rigatoni and the halibut. Right away you can see that the rigatoni comes in a pretty good sized serving. The sauce and meatballs were delicious and had a pleasantly spicy kick to it. I definitely recommend this dish! The halibut was pretty disappointing. It was charred, but a little too charred. Some bites tasted like nothing but char, which was annoying. The rice & sauce that accompanies the halibut was good though. If you're interested in this dish, I'd strongly recommend requesting it to be just lightly charred.
The service here was excellent. Our server gave us a good recommendation for wine and was friendly and attentive all evening long. I've heard that sometimes servers at pricier restaurants can be a little biased against you if you're there for SRW, but they really seem to embrace SRW here.
Overall, Tavolata is not one of my favorites for Italian food but it's still pretty good. Personally, I probably wouldn't come back for anything other than Happy Hour or SRW because there are better affordable options around, but if you decide to come here for dinner it's a solid choice.","Elly L.","We had their gnocchetti and pappardelle when we visited Seattle last year. The pastas were al dente and the flavors were very good. I liked the pappardelle flavor a lil more. Gnocchetti's flavor was a lil less than what I expected, but nonetheless it was still good. And they give a generous amount of pasta and sauce.
Next time when I'm in Seattle and is craving for good Italian pasta, I would like to come back here.","Naveed N.","Yet another Ethan Stowell homerun!
We had reservations for restaurant week- but because I'm a bottomless pit, we figured it wouldn't be enough food and stopping in for happy hour just before would be the right move.
Sat at the bar for happy hour and enjoyed some drinks, and small bites- The baked gnocchi will forever live in my dreams.. truly fantastic.
Dinner/Drinks overall were really great, and I particularly enjoyed the hangar steak they were offering at the time for restaurant week.
It was a bit noisy in the restaurant which made conversation difficult, but I also wasn't expecting a quiet/low-key dining experience so that is okay! I've yet to visit again but plan to fulfill my gnocchi craving very soon. Cheers!","Marina K.","Omg the potato gnocchi is the best! Cocktails and service is lovely as well. Great place for family or friend dinner and maybe a first date. We came on a week day around 6pm and got a table no problem but call ahead to make sure they have room. Nice kinda dark ambiance as well. I will def be back!","Emily H.","Outstanding pasta! A little pricey, but if you're looking for a trendy (possibly intimate) dinner spot and you don't mind paying a little more for your pasta then check it out! I came here with a group of girls for a friend's birthday and we had a great time. Shared the brussels sprouts, they were a little too salty for me but everyone else liked them. For dinner we each got either traditional spaghetti, the butter noodles, or sausage rigatoni. We agreed the rigatoni with the spicy sausage was the best, but the spaghetti was delicious too! The buttered noodles (called something fancier on the menu) were actually pretty good considering it's a rather basic dish. We shared the donuts for dessert and the chocolate sauce they came with was amazing.","Sachi E.","fun fact: they light every single candle every day!! The ambiance of the restaurant was typical for an Italian restaurant. their food was delicious, my opinion a little over priced - still good tho. Their dessert was my favorite part! Highly recommend their creme brulee :)","Avelina A.","I am a big fan of Tavolàta! The ambiance, the food, the service were all top-notch! This is a great place to take your out of town guests or your date. I ended up trying the rigatoni which had a lovely spicy kick to the dish. The pasta was made fresh and really elevated the whole dish to another level. The only dish I didn't care for is the bruschetta. It was made with this smoked salmon that came across as a tuna concoction that did not leave a taste to be desired. But I definitely would come back and try more from the menu since everything else was superb!","Joel Y.","Deeeelicious! Came here on a Saturday night and even though it was busy, was able to find seating almost right away. The service was great, ambience was superb, and the food was yum.
Ordered the roasted beets which were the best beets I've ever had along with the Pappardelle and the Gnocchi Alla Romana. The food was tasty and wasn't too overfilling which was perfect. Also the drinks where outstanding. Definitely a good place to go if you're in the area.","Sarah N.","We stopped in for late night food after our flight landed and we are so Glad we came here. We were hungry, tired, and just need a good meal.
This is true homemade Italian! The ambiance and wait staff and accommodating and amazing. They help with suggestions and are prompt to check on you. The food is so fresh, homemade, and delicious. So many flavors go into each dish that make every bite appreciated.
Wine and beer selection is great - cocktails available too. Would recommend or go back if we have the chance!","Ellen C.","I forgot how good this place is, having gone to the Cap Hill location. My friends and I stopped by for dinner Friday night at around 8pm and got seated quickly without reservations. I ordered the rigatoni and let me say that the pasta was cooked to perfection. I ate that entire dish as if I've never had pasta in my life.
Highly recommend if you've never tried this restaurant.","Julia P.","LOVE the happy hour menu!! Super affordable and tasty dishes. My personal favorite is the pappardelle, but everything is also delicious. The bread was fresh and warm and the spices and flavors they use in their pastas really come through. I'm no expert in Italian food but and I can tell this is GOOD Italian food :)
If you decide to come here, definitely try go for the happy hour. The bar does fill up quickly so try to come early. Best to come with 2 people.","Henry L.","Solid quality food. Love the pasta here. I think the portions are pretty reasonable. I've never had enough to take home and have never left feeling hungry either.
Service has always been excellent when I've been here. The place can get really loud. Lots of concrete for sound to reverberate.
During Seattle Restaurant Week, this is one of my favorites spots. Why? They just let you order off the regular menu while most other restaurants limit the choices.","Kelsey B.","HAPPY HOURRRRRRR!
But for real. Come for the HH. Daily from 5-7PM and it is literally the best deal in town. I am actually not sure why people come at 5PM and they choose not to sit in the bar area. Small plates ranging from $6-10 and the pastas are $11-12 instead of the regular priced $18-23. And they sure don't skimp on the portions - definitely super filing (I sometimes even have to bring 1/2 home). Plus some drink specials.
I love everything about this place, a super cozy vibe, you can see the open kitchen with the guys making fresh pasta; and in the summer there is a nice little patio out front for great people watching in Belltown.
Great service, amazing food, date night, girls night, friends in town go to Tavolata you won't be disappointed!","Yvette G.","My friends and I came here so I could carb load before my Spartan race a few weeks ago. One of my friends had been here before and recommended this place.
We conveniently arrived during Happy Hour and ordered the Grand Central Baguette and the Bruschetta. I ordered the spaghetti for my entree. Everything was delicious. I especially enjoyed the marinated caciocavallo and the meatballs. They were extremely flavorful, and really hit the spot. If I am ever in Seattle again, I would definitely return."
"List","https://www.yelp.com/biz/list-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Helen H.","My new Monday night spot, when they have all day happy hour!
This time I got the
- burger: decent, wouldn't buy again
- flatbread: yum though a bit heavy on the feta
- truffle gnocchi: delicious, so so so so delicious, must have!
Service was fast too, they don't take reservations, and lastly sitting near the door may be a bit cold!","Katherine Y.","During happy hour everything on ""The Food List"" is 50% off! The restaurant is much smaller than expected but it didn't feel cramped.
Gnocchi- MUST GET! The best gnocchi I've ever had. So soft and pillowy. It melted in my mouth.
Clams- Tasted fresh and clean
Bacon wrapped prawns- great combo of sweet and savory
Cannelloni- tasted like a giant cheese ball. Didn't have much dimension.
Natural Beef Shoulder Tenderloin- meh, passable. Steak was too charred and lacked flavor.
Grilled Chilean Sea Bass- light flavor on the fish & salty veggies.","Andrew S.","Read the reviews for this place so decided to come with my girlfriend for date night. We were visiting from Vancouver BC Canada so had to try.
The ambience is dark with some overhead chandeliers with dim light bulbs. The music is loud and more of dance style/fast beat so it was a bit odd. Maybe the music is to get people to eat faster. We were at the bar as it was packed. They don't take reservations so I don't recommend coming as a large group. Maybe max 4 people in a group.
The food was good. We ordered the octopus salad, gnocchi and beef tenderloin steak. The octopus was good, had a nice charcoal taste with a little spice. It wasn't chewy or overcooked. The gnocchi was super soft that you didn't really need to use a knife to cut in half. Our gnocchi dish seemed smaller than what other people had posted before. The tenderloin was supposed to be medium rare but seemed more medium. It was still tender and the sauce tasted like a red wine reduction.
We didn't take any photos of the food since the bar has red light so everything would have looked super red.","Julie S.","Happy hour is all day on Monday's, and the deals are amazing. $20 bottle of wine, and half off of all plates. Total score, and the food is amazing. The gnocchi is the best dish ever.. if I could eat it every day for the rest of my life, i would die happy.
As echoed in some of the other reviews, the wait can be pretty frustrating. They might say it will be a 20 minute wait, but then it will end up being close to an hour. It's usually quicker to get a bar seat.
Most people who come here return several times after because the food is so good, and it's a special experience.","David B.","Review based on a great tapas type bar visit.
We sampled a whole bunch and came away impressed all the way.
Cocktails were righteously made. Wine pours generous.
Arugula salad near perfect. Meatballs delicious.
Gnocchi right on target. Shrimp great.
The only downer was the choice of tomatoes for the heirloom salad. They were tired and mealy. Based on the rest it was just an oversight.
Looking forward to the next few visits.","Dominic D.","After reading endless positive reviews and seeing a 4.5/5 rating, I was super exited to grab food here on date night. We dropped in on a Wednesday for happy hour food/drinks (6pm). Loved the prices, but admittedly didn't love the food.
First, I will comment that prices are exceptionally good during happy hour. Also, their happy hour stretches a bit longer than most. From a food perspective, I wasn't in love with most dishes. Octopus salad smelled slightly fishy (possibly fish sauce?), and could have been grilled a little longer for my liking. Ahi tuna needed more flavour--salt or brine (miso/soy) would make this much better. Baked broccoli wasn't really baked, or not to our expectations (ie. crispy, crunchy). Gnocci with black truffle was my favourite. Lots of truffle flavour. Definite recommend. The clams in broth also lacked good flavour.
Ambiance is interesting. Dark romantic lighting, but music reminded me of a dinner club. More upbeat/dance.","Ruth C.","The happy hour here is incredible: half off items on the food list, beer for $4.50, and wine for $5.50. The handmade gnocchi with black truffle cream is to DIE for! It has the perfect texture and the creamy sauce is so delectable. Additionally, the baked broccoli is perfectly crispy and seasoned, and honestly is a thousand times better than Black Bottle's blasted broccoli (which everyone seems to love). List's baked broccoli is the broccoli dish you *should* be raving about.
My husband tried the grilled chilean sea bass and the lamb and beef burger with potatoes. He enjoyed both and would also give List a 5-star rating.
I love the lighting and atmosphere. It's small, cozy, and intimate. The dim lighting makes for a romantic date night, but it doesn't feel uppity at all, so you could totally still come here for a bite with friends.
Staff and service are great. Be sure to have your ID ready at the door, as you have to be 21+ to dine here.
Overall, highly recommend! A gem in Belltown.","Heath D.","LOVE this place. We were wandering around Seattle downtown at night and had already had a very poor and expensive experience at a renowned restaurant down the road. Came across this gem and it did not disappoint. The drinks were fabulous. The food was tapas style and we dove into plate after plate to try an arrangement of different meats and seafood. Happy Hour was kicking and we are so glad we found this place. Clean restrooms, friendly service staff, and constant refills of water with ICE! Can't wait to return and enjoy everything List offers.","Kristie C.","Oof I feel really bad doing this, but the food was not my jam.
- AMBIANCE: dark and loud club lounge music (can't hear your own thoughts) and IKEA PLATES!!! And a mix of other plates too but wow haha.
- PRICE: half off was great before 6:30, but tbh I think it's the optimistic side of the fair value of the food (most items $11-18 at full price, portions more like tapas) $25pp after discount which wasn't bad but wasn't edible
- FOOD: I couldn't eat more than a bite of most items, didn't like :(
TLDR: friendly service, nay to the loudness and not good food. will not be back :(
----
Listing full prices (BEST TO WORST)
- flatbread $12, GOOD: the only thing I'd get again. Chewy flatbread and cranberries. Love feta
- tomato salad $11, PASS: 3 tomatoes, and a tofu looking stick of cheese
- baked broccoli $10, PASS: broccoli soaked in evoo and garlic, nothing you can't make at home
- chicken $14, Yish: can't even see it below the bizarre Marsala looking sauce and mushrooms. Sauce was like a fusion sweet and sour? With pounded and likely floured chicken? Not a fan
- sea bass $18, Yish: fishy and frozen tasting with a base of tomato something risotto I couldn't get on board with","Dhanashree A.","It has been on ""to try"" list for the longest time. I have been here once two years back but I didn't remember what I ate. Only remembered that I had loved the food. But the lines always scared me away. Decided to make the trip from Bothell during winter break so we came here on a Thursday at 9 pm for their happy hour. They still had a few tables open and we were seated immediately. You gotta love the happy hour deals here. All food items except featured ones are half off, the house red and white by glass is 5.50 $, by bottle is 19$ and draft beer is 4.50$ per glass. If I lived close by I would be a regular here.
The food is just fantastic. I loved their flavors! Everything is on point and the seasoning is phenomenal. We tried their gnocchi with truffle oil, sea bass grilled, clams is white wine sauce and crostini, octopus salad, chicken in mushroom sauce and their chocolate tortino dessert. Everything was amazing would recommend all! Specially highly recommend their gnocchi, it's the best I've had so far. The hype is real. We loved it so much that we ended up getting one more plate. The flavors were bang on across the board. Plus all of this at half price off!! The dessert was a moist chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato. If I have to nit pick, I think the sea bass was a bit overcooked, clams were a little sandy and although the flavor of the gelato was awesome, I found it a little icy. But no major negatives! The service is good, nothing much to say there. Our server was nice, she did her job, nothing more nothing less.
After one drink each, 6 food items and one dessert we paid 77$ before tip between 3 people! Don't miss this place, specially in their happy hour and they have it everyday. I can't believe it look me 2 years to go back. I won't be waiting that long before my next visit!!","Autumn S.","I loved the gnocchi! If I ever visit Seattle again I will def be back. We went for my birthday dinner and I enjoyed everything from the gnocchi to the drinks and dessert.
FYI the bacon wrapped shrimp are SPICY, it set my mouth on fire.","Phattra V.","Definitely recommend trying this place on a Sunday when it's all day happy hour. My boyfriend and I arrived Sunday night, a little after 8pm, and were seated immediately. The atmosphere is trendy yet cozy and casual. We order 5 plates: Calamari, Octopus Salad, Canneloni, Clams, and Bacon-wrapped Prawns. I was dying to try the Gnocci but they had sold out for the night. It's just another excuse to come back, and we will definitely be back. Everything we tried was cooked so well, and extremely flavorful. My favorite dish was the Octopus Salad. I don't think that we could've gone wrong with any dishes that were on the food list, tbh. 5 plates of quality food for under $50, sold.","Carol L.","I really wanted to love List because of how much these reviews raved about the food and the service. But I honestly can't.
I was originally told to wait 45 minutes for my party of 4...but ended up waiting 2.5+ hours. The worst part was that the server was constantly letting smaller groups cut in front of us. As a result, 6 groups who came after us were seated even though we were 1st on the waiting list. I honestly wouldn't have minded the wait, but it's just more frustrating to hear from servers that our table will be ""ready soon"" and then turn to see someone who JUST walked in the door get seated.
The saving grace of this place was definitely the food. It's why I give this place 2 stars instead of 1. We ordered the broccoli, grilled octopus salad, spicy meatballs, handmade gnocchi with black truffle cream, bacon-wrapped wild gulf prawns, and grilled Chilean sea bass. Everything tasted pretty good and I recommend all the dishes above except the broccoli. I think you can make the broccoli at home and it's nothing really special. If you can, go during their happy hour since their dishes are discounted.","Winnie Y.","My friends and I shared a few dishes including gnocchi and chilean sea bass. We also shared a bottle of a white wine (forgot what it was called! but I think it was the only option for that happy hour period). It was busy inside around the happy hour time that we came at, but we were seated somewhat quickly at the bar area that was directly next to the doorway (not ideal, but we just wanted to be seated). We were provided with water, and not soon after, we were asked if we wanted to move to the table out in the patio, which was perfect!
The food was delicious and good quality, especially paired with the wine, and service was excellent. Our waitress checked in on us frequently, but not too frequently, and we had a good time overall. My only warning to future patrons is that while the patio seating is really bright and lovely compared to the dark (and noisy) inside, it does get a bit dusty sometimes and you might find some dusty particles in your beverages lol!","Ashley S.","PAN ROASTED NATURAL CHICKEN, SEA SALT AND PEPPER CALAMARI, SEARED AHI TUNA FILET
Price: $7, $6.5, $8 (happy hour prices, 1/2 off Original prices)
Ratings: 3.5/5; it's a little pricy if you go after happy hour but quality overall wasn't too bad! There's happy hour on Sunday and Mondays all day, Tuesday-Thursday from 4:30-6:30 pm, 9-midnight, and Friday-Saturday from 4:30-6:30 pm. For happy hour price, it's pretty worth it! We shared about 3 dishes amongst 3 people. It was an okay amount for each dish, so I would recommend getting another dish if this is for dinner. I felt like one dish would definitely not fill me up if this was my meal LOL service was really good though! Definitely recommend getting their calamari as it's seasoned very well.","Niyati G.","Love everything about List - ambience, music and most importantly, the food! My fav is their pink gnocchi. I moved to Seattle from LA and such kind of cool spots are hard to find around here. Another unbelievable fact is, they have happy hour on food starting 9pm even on weekends!","Jeanette R.","Yum! This is by far one of the best happy hours in Seattle. Delicious plates all half off and an excellent selection of craft cocktails. The menu is extensive for a small place, and even though there are tables outside the bar area, this is a bar and no kids allowed! I, personally like that a lot....
Bacon wrapped shrimp and crispy broccoli, halibut, etc etc etc- I cant remember everything we ordered, but, it was the perfect start to the night.
Bartender was very friendly and helpful and made delicious drinks with creative flair. Try out this place - you'll agree, I'm sure!","Catherine L.","wow. Went there with a couple of girlfriends and we loved every dish. I will definitely will be back to try more!
Had: the truffle gnocchi (I need more truffle gnocchi in my life!!), the goat flatbread (super good, hearty and chewy bread), the mozzarella salad, which was bright and fresh, the bacon wrapped shrimp (channeling my inner Ron Swanson), and it was delicious!! I also had a cocktail that was really yummy and paired a malbec with the food perfectly. Can't wait to be back.","Bob S.","We had some really great small plates, wine and conversation here. Our server Sarah was super sweet and helpful. We tried the baked broccoli, tomato salad, lettuce/goat cheese and pear salad, sea bass, and chicken w/mushrooms. I could skip the chicken but everything else was fantastic! We also finished off with hot chocolate cake and ice cream... yumm!
Definitely worth a try.","Ariella P.","Yum! We popped into List right as they opened to take advantage of the happy hour deal. Otherwise, this would be out of our price point for a weekend dinner. It's very dark in the restaurant and the mirror walls definitely make it feel much bigger. Hard to take pictures of the food because of this, but I really enjoyed the gnocchi and the goat cheese pear salad. My party mates enjoyed their broccoli and meat balls. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Definitely worth dropping in for a romantic dinner."
"Bizzarro Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bizzarro-italian-cafe-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Tayler H.","Bizzaros is a kooky and perfect little Italian hole-in-the-wall! I 10/10 recommend eating here. It's easy to access right off the I-5 freeway, and is in a very cute and ""old"" restaurant row.
The restaurant itself is very homey, with ""bizzare"" decor. Loved the romantic/fun lighting. Our waitress was very nice.
The food itself was fresh and different than what I've had before. We really enjoyed our dinner here!","Jessica M.","The food didn't match the hype for us, but the service was exceptional.
3 stars for the food and 5 for the service so we'll leave it a 4 overall.
Came here on a Monday night just before the prime dinner rush, and thankfully we did. This place was fulllll. Even with two large parties, our server gave us plenty of attention and was so sweet. This restaurant has parking right in front, although only a handful of spots, and has the quirkiest decor.
We ordered the meatballs and spaghetti with starter salad, elk bolognese with onion soup, and the fainting goat gelato for dessert.
The pasta itself was just ok - I really wished I had liked it more given all the raving reviews. I'm tempted to come back here to try some of the other pasta dishes though.","Linda L.","Came here for dinner and the experience absolutely blew my mind. The environment is quirky and unique, and the service is excellent. The food though - - WOW. We had the arancini to start. The sauce around the arancini was some of the best that I have ever tasted. We also tried the seasonal pumpkin gnocchi with Italian sausage, as well as the wild mushroom parapadelle. Both were very rich, with superb flavor. I can't wait to go back to try the wild elk bolognese, which is their most popular dish. They serve wine casual Italian style, out of rocks glasses.
If you come after 5:30 you can expect a wait. Definitely will be a wait if you come after 6","Patrick C.","This is the cutest cafe with lots of little bits and baubles everywhere. The place is always busy and usually requires a wait. After a handful of visits, I think I'm done with Bizzarros cafe. The food quality for the price point just isn't up to snuff. I recently ordered some cacio e peppe - and it was like eating a giant bowl of bland noddles. I would guess that to make that dish a star you need super fresh and spicy pepper along with noodles cooked to perfection. Nope. I think for the money Zouave over on 65th is much, and less insanely crowded.","Mahsa S.","the restaurant has a great atmosphere with eclectic decor. It's fairly small so expect a long wait. The food was good but a bit expensive for just simple marinara pasta and cheese. The complimentary bread was delicious though","Sandra G.","Loved the unique atmosphere. Felt very cozy. Great food and drinks. A must when in Seattle.","Regina X.","Snap pea carbonara had the right flavors with the heavy cheesiness cut by the crispy snap peas and pancetta. The linguini, however, was overcooked and a sad lump hard to separate. For appetizer, the Arancini rice balls were heavy and cheesy but made for a nicely textured dish. Love the outlandish decor and would be back for more pasta.","Nishita K.","Highly recommend the tiramisu! Best I have had in a long time. Aranciji was okay. The pastas were delicious. The proportions were great. I had the seasonal pasta 'bombastica'. It was white wine based not too acidic. Very light and flavorful. The elk pasta was hearty and very flavoful. I thought I wouldn't like it because it's elk meat but I would definitely get it for myself next time. Forest floor frenzy as well as the chicken main course we're delicious. Service was great! The servers were very cheerful and gave some nice recommendations and answered our questions. They served us some bread while we waited for our food. We waited for about 30/35 mins on a Friday night to get a table for 4.","SonyA C.","This is my favorite Italian place in Seattle. It has a cozy and interesting ambiance and the food is phenomenal. I especially love the bread and the seasonal dishes. Each entree comes with a fresh salad, with optional upgrade to Caesar salad, spinach salad, or soup. I honestly liked the starter salad the best.
All our dishes felt very high quality. They were well made and their ingredients seemed especially good. My favorite dish was the forest floor frenzy and it's assortment of mushrooms. So tasty.
In conclusion, this would be a great place for a date night. Tasty food, cozy ambiance, unusual decor, and not too loud to have conversation. Watch out though, it's popular and if you go at prime dinner time, you'll need to wait.","Alex O.","I don't like it. The bread was just not tasty and it felt old & stale. I got the eggplant Parmesan fritters for the appetizer. It was inconsistent. Sometimes it was spicy and sometimes it wasn't. It also felt like an amateur cooked it. Cut slices of eggplant, deep fry it, slather tomato sauce and cheese. Serve. Felt very fast food. The forest floor is basically mushroom sauce and pasta. If you love mushrooms then get this. Otherwise, it has an overwhelming amount of fungi. The sugar snap carbonara was a huge disappointment. Trust me the pasta is not made in house and if it is...it sure doesn't taste like it. It felt over cooked and soggy and reminded me of ramen noodles. Also, the sauce is bland. The reason why people like it is because the bacon and peas have a lot of flavor.
The garlic soup is extra buttery and has cloves of garlic. It was way too extreme for me.
Dessert sucked!! Honestly, if they bought the dessert from an outside source it would have probably tasted better.","Jessica T.","My family and I were on vacation in Seattle and stopped here for dinner. We all loved the look and feel of the place. Atmosphere is definitely bizzarro.
There was no wait time for a table of 4/weeknight.
Starter salad had a mild, sweet dressing that even our pickiest teenager enjoyed.
Food was really good. Forest Floor Frenzy was creamy and mushroomy heaven.
Lasagna- good
Meatballs-great
Antipasta plate-great
What else about this place? The bathrooms. Weird recording playing in one of them with paintings of big eyed children. Creepy and intriguing.","Ray M.","This spot is a must for locals and visitors. It is quintessential Seattle in all the right ways.
I love this spot because it is as fun as it is tasty. And it is very fun... and very tasty. So much eye candy and everything on the menu is ridiculously good.
If you haven't been to Bizzarro, then I recommend you go. And if you are planning to go to Bizzarro, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the lasagna - you're welcome :) Enjoy","Jacob H.","I have been to Bizzarro countless times and there is always something new to see on the walls or ceiling. They definitely have the classic Italian theme going for them, which is matched by exquisite Italian food. They have some of the best dishes in Seattle, with a good mixture of light and heavy dishes that are sure to make everyone happy. The staff is wonderful, knowledgeable, and attentive, but not overly attentive.
They only downside is they do not take reservations. But there are several spots around where you can go to grab a drink while your table is prepared.
If you are looking for THE Italian dinning experience in Seattle, this is your spot!","Nita L.","Most aptly named, this place is a Bizarre combination of Romantic yet Eclectic.
Ambience:
You have candle lit tables and an assortment of chandeliers, you also have skeletal brides seated on a carriage hanging off the ceiling. (Not kidding)
Food:
We had the Elk Bolognese: My first time tasting Elk, and for those who are afraid to try it, this tastes very similar to lamb. The pasta and elk were both fantastic. If you are familiar with the Pakistani/Indian dish called ""Kheema"", this was like having Elk Kheema over pasta. Delicious!
We also had the ""I gnocchi what you did last summer"", delicious creamy gnocchi. Those who like blue cheese will love this. It is cooked in a walnut and blue cheese based sauce.
We ended the meal with the Tiramisu for dessert. It was Humungous and delightful to the last bite.
Service & Cost:
The servers are friendly and service is quick. The prices here are not too terrible, cost us ~70 (not including tip) for two people- we had a carafe of wine, two entrees and dessert. Pretty decent for the food & ambience!
I've read other reviews complaining about the wait time, but I went on a Tuesday evening so I did not face this issue. Definitely a fantasic choice for your dose of Italian, Romance and crazy! Ill be back for sure.","Stacey P.","Full disclosure - I came here after a full day of drinking at the Scotch and Beer Festival followed by a couple hours at a bar. What I'm saying is this is my perception drunk.
My friends really wanted to take me and another friend here and I'll admit I was a little hesitant. The word ""Bizarro"" filled my head with a clown and circus theme, for some reason (drunk), and I didn't want to deal with clowns. There were no clowns.
I recall there being a wait but we stood outside where there was plenty of room to talk and it was nice. There wasn't any room inside to wait. Once inside they seated us in the back corner. I didn't feel too crowded and took in the assortment of stuff that was everywhere. While no rhyme or reason seemed to be had it reminded me of having dinner in one of those antique stores you find in a small town surrounded by stuff in every direction.
The bread was good - thick and chewy. The olive oil was ok, the balsamic vinegar was on the spot. Their lasagna was unremarkable to me. It was noodly goodness with heavy marinara and...I don't recall the cheese. I mean, I'm sure there was cheese because lasagna has cheese but it didn't pierce my drunken haze. My friend had this bolognese dish that was delightful - salty, flavorful, great noodles, fantastic meat. I recall taking full advantage of her permitting me to eat it and then giving my leftover lasagna for them to take home.
The service was utilitarian. They weren't overly talkative, friendly, or engaging. We came in late and I imagine they were tired. It seemed like lots of different people came to drop off and pick up dishes. Our waitress became a little cross with us as I wasn't the only one inebriated and our slow pace at ordering combined with not being as specific as she needed made her irritated. I can't blame her.
We all Ubered home after. It was nice, different, and a change of pace.","Chong H.","Best chicken Marsala this side of the Mississippi!","Samantha O.","We had someone recommend this place to us, and overall I did enjoy this restaurant. I probably wouldn't hurry to return, but if I really wanted Italian food (not generally my favorite cuisine so this doesn't happen often) then I'd come back. We came here at about 7:30 pm on a Sunday evening, and the two of us were seated right away. The service was a little slow at first but it did pick up after we placed our entree orders. There was a bit of a mix up with our appetizer order, but we ended up enjoying the arancini (the one that was accidentally brought to us- we were not charged for this) FAR more than the bruschetta we ordered.
Just to get this over with: their version of bruschetta was honestly one of the worst things I've ever eaten. This sounds like I'm being dramatic, I know, but goodness what an odd flavor combination. I would not call myself picky and I'm able to eat pretty much anything people put on my plate, but this... was a no-go for me. We both felt bad about the mix up so we tried to force ourselves to eat more of the bruschetta but it was just so bad that I couldn't. Weird flavors, way, WAY too sweet for an appetizer. The only positive part of this dish was the bread it was on, but it was ruined by the sickly sweet reduction and the horrendous gorgonzola. People on yelp seem to really enjoy it, but I'm just here to tell you- it won't be for everyone. It's unfortunate because I feel like they could do a classic savory bruschetta beautifully, but I understand wanting to do something more unique, I guess.
The arancini was quite good, on the other hand. This was the appetizer that was mistakenly served to us (just to be clear, we pointed this out to our waiter and he asked if we just wanted to keep it- we didn't just dive in). Honestly, even though we felt bad about the mix up, we were glad it happened because of the whole bruschetta situation. This made up for the bruschetta. Our waiter described them as fried balls of risotto with fontina cheese and saffron. The marinara it was served on had a lovely, light smokey flavor. I'd order this one again.
The complimentary focaccia comes with olive oil and balsamic to dip it in. Every aspect of this was delicious. The olive oil tasted amazing. You could even do without an appetizer if you wanted to because of this amazing bread.
For my entree I chose the Sicilian pesto, which was in the seasonal section of the menu. At first I wasn't too impressed flavor wise, but then when I mixed the dish up a bit more the flavors were dispersed much more evenly. I ate the leftovers the next day and it was better after the flavors melded together more. Probably wouldn't order this one again due to how dull it was despite the exciting description. The entrees come with a starter salad, but you can substitute for another type of salad or soup for $4. I got the caesar salad. I loved it. It was beautiful- and they put anchovies on it which I personally enjoy. (Our waiter asked me if the anchovies were okay with me, so if you don't want them then you're able to omit them.) My boyfriend got the started salad, which he said was ""not that great."" The $4 sounds crazy, but the caesar salad I got was probably three times the size of what my boyfriend got. Also if you love caesar salad like I do then it's worth a try in my opinion.
For his entree he ordered the margarita and added the meaty bolognese. The rolled pasta was beautiful. The flavors were simple and tasty.
He doesn't like coffee flavored things or coffee in general, and I somehow persuaded him to try the tiramisu. He actually enjoyed it! The coffee flavor wasn't too strong for him, which he was worried about. I loved everything about the tiramisu and would definitely order this dessert again.
The service was a bit slow at first, like I mentioned earlier. But after we ordered everything was pretty efficient. Our waiter was really nice and didn't check on us too much or too little. The only thing that I thought was a little annoying was their ""no phone"" policy. I mean. I get it. You want to be the place where people talk to each other instead of looking at a screen the entire time. You don't want people talking loudly on their phones, ignoring the wait-staff because they're on their phones, or doing some other annoying crap like that. Understandable. I just find policies like this to be pretentious and try-hard. Just my opinion.","Milton F.","Cozy little Italian restaurant not far from Green Lake. Came here based on the yelp ratings and pictures of the decor.
I ordered the Margarita Pasta with meat sauce which was pretty good. Not sure what kind of pasta they used as I had never seen it before, but the baked melted cheese on top coupled with the meat sauce was quite tasty but very heavy.
The decor was definitely bizaarre as they had random things hanging from the ceiling. The bathroom was a little creepy with a recording of someone chanting random numbers.
One yelper stated that the servers randomly break out in song and dance but we didn't experience that.. bummer.","Katy H.","The olive oil here was some of the best I've ever had. The focaccia was also tasty, and was mostly just helpful in getting more olive oil into my mouth. You should check this place out for that alone.
The pasta special was good, and even the cheese sprinkled on top was notable. Sadly, the steak was too tough and a bit overcooked with an overwhelming parsnip flavor.
When paired with the nice service, fun decor, and creamsicle pannacotta for dessert, this makes for a nice place to visit.","Jessica S.","This is the kind of place that ""new Seattle"" needs more of - but not the kind of place you can build in a day. It's the opposite of generic and mod - it's utterly kitschy in the way that only a place that has been around for years can be: suspended from the ceiling are Christmas trees and bicycles for two, while under the glass table toppers are assorted antique photos, and so on. It's a visual treat.
Also a treat is the food. We started with Arancini balls, which were doused in a delicious fresh tomato sauce, but retained a crisp coating around the delicious, cheesy and gooey rice filling. From there, we had the soup of the day, a creamy garlic soup loaded with flavor, which is almost a meal in itself. For my main course, I had the spaghetti carbonara with pea shoots, which featured delightful, fresh pasta noodles, lightly sauced. Honestly, anything would be good with those noodles - they were perfection.
The waitress was friendly and very real, and service was prompt but well-paced. The placed was packed, and though we didn't have to wait for a table, there was a line out the door when we left.
So much old-school awesome! We'll be back."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Monica L.","I'm not a pasta lover whatsoever. I eat pasta maybe once or twice a year. But I about licked my plate and my friend's plate. Holy moly. I couldn't get enough of my lasagna and her campanelle.
The staff is super friendly too. You pick up your food, grab your own water, and bus your own table. You have to go up to the counter to order too. There's no waiter but nobody cares because the pasta is out of this world.
It's too bad I don't live right above the building. I'm now a total convert.","Jessica C.","Great little pasta place. The price was good. The pasta was fresh.
They do a build your own style ordering. You pick a sauce and a pasta
Got the mushroom and white truffle sauce with fettuccine. I kinda wish I got it with the recommended pasta or was a bit wavy and curled which held the sauce much better than flat fettuccine noodles BUT it was much more al dente than the fettuccine. And I like my pasta soft.
Added the sausage to it but it wasn't too much of a difference. The sauce was so flavorful didn't need the meat.","Yash D.","Great fresh pasta and choice of sauces. It was pretty laid back on a Friday night. Lots of vegetarian options. Don't forget to:
1. Clean up after you leave.
2. Order bread with your pasta dish.","Marie B.","I love pasta and have been to just about every Italian spot in Seattle. Handmade pasta, I'm there! Pasta in a casual setting, even better! Most often though, I don't have access to the likes of Il Corvo, Pasta Casalinga, G.H. Pasta, Ristorante Machiavelli, Tavolata, or La Vita e Bella because I currently don't work in Seattle.
However, the very first Yelper I ever met is credited for the recommendation to Due' Cucina Italiana *Bryan K* Clearly, I had been under a rock and late to the pasta bowl party at this popular Capitol Hill/Broadway spot. I've interacted with the two brothers than run DCI, great charismatic business owners. Brilliant concept and business hours until 2200! Great counter staff and efficient kitchen crew. A variety of seating are available whether dining solo, pairs or larger groups. Just remember to kindly bus your table at the end!
My first visit was back in December 2018 (been open since October 2016!) and have been back so many times that honestly I've lost count. This is a long overdue Yelp review as I just had a custom pasta bowl for dunch/linner hours ago (1/27/20).
Assorted fresh pasta that's crafted on site. Your pasta bowl is customized by selecting type of pasta, sauce, and other ingredients from the giant wall signage. Order and pay at the counter, then find a place to sit if dining onsite. There's also brisk takeout and delivery traffic.
In about 15-20 minutes your name is called or check the status on the order monitor. I like to admire my pasta bowl and then dig in while nice and hot. Feeling raveneous, one can easily polish off a bowl. Most often, I have tasty leftovers for another meal.
Another item I've had often (but not today) is their delicious tiramisu. Enough to share, or not!
So thank you Bryan K, Due' Cucina Italiana has become one of my regular spots.
High quality, delicious, affordable, satisfying, highly recommended!","Cristina G.","I have ordered this twice to be delivered to my office using uber eats. This is the best italian pasta I have eaten in Seattle with the exception of Barolo. The pasta is definitely made freshly from scratch and cooked perfectly al dente chewy.
My favorite dish is the mushroom and truffle oil pasta The first time, i went with another reviewer's suggestion and added pork. I decided I liked it better without pork since pork was flavorful but a little greasy.
Last time I ordered a pasta with another type of ragu and it was also great but needing cheese. Make sure you request extra cheese if you order this pasta.
I would pass on ordering any of the breads.","Julia L.","Had a lovely lunch here recently! The place is modern, clean, well lit (large windows) with plenty of open seating. Remember to seat yourself & bus your own table. My group tried a variety of the sauces...
- traditional bolognese: rich, hearty, filling
- cacio & pepe: the cheese flavor was very sharp and strong, delicious but a bit too much for me
- amatriciana: lots of tomato flavors + smokey, savory goodness in the form of guanciale (cured pork cheek)
- mushroom & white truffle oil: creamy, thick, but not too heavy. Wonder, well balanced flavors between the mushroom and truffle oil (personal favorite out of the 4 sauces)
The pastas were all fresh and perfectly al dente (firm, chewy). Personally enjoyed the rigatoni and ca campanelle best. Would recommend and come back again!","Pauli D.","Fresh pasta + mushroom sauce =
----
Every time I go to @duecucina I become more and more of a fan. It's a place that has definitely grown on me. The pastas are light, more my style for lunch, and very very fresh!
----
My favorite at the moment would be the mushroom sauce. Simple and yet the umami really shines through. What do you get here?","Edward A.","Friendly staff, in a way. I was told the order line starts near the entrance. I thought i had to order at the food pickup area. Oops.
I had eggplant parmesan. Pretty tasty little appetizer dish. My wife had the only pasta dish that was rated high on the al dente-ish. Those noodles were rather undercooked. Felt like i was eating them raw. But i guess thats what it is by definition? I can definitely see the appeal.","Yvonne Yiyao X.","Can't believe it took me so long to find this place. Friendly service. Reasonably priced. Food is fast and fresh. Delicious sauce. Pasta is al dente. I loved both pasta dishes and the tiramisu. I see their take out orders coming out rapidly. The store is not super busy or overwhelming. The owner actually cares about his business and was cleaning up here and there. The kitchen is bright and clean - always a good thing to be able to see the kitchen.
Four stars but only because of my love to Il Corvo. This is a place I'll certainly come back soon.","Derek H.","AMBIANCE
I'm a huge fan of white tile on white grout walls because it really brightens up the place. The servers are super friendly and nice. Food came out in less than ten minutes. It's cool to see all the pasta being made behind the counter. The place is really clean.
FOOD
We went with the Mushroom and White Truffle Oil with Pork Sausage and the Traditional Bolognese both with their recommended pastas. You could definitely taste the freshness of the pasta (not that I had any doubt because they literally make it behind the counter). The noodles had a great bounce, while still remaining a perfect al dente.
The sauces were great, but honestly just didn't fit my preferred palette. Completely a personal thing. The wine hints in the bolognese were too pronounced for my liking. I prefer a meatier and drier bolognese. It was hard to taste the truffle in the other dish. Then again it's $13, you can't expect much. I would have preferred more cream, but again, it's just personal preference!
OVERALL
Great vibe, I love being able to choose different sauces and noodles. I'd come back if I was in the area for a different dish.","Brianna F.","We came here on a Thursday evening for a double date to celebrate a couple birthdays and it was packed! Due Cucina Italiana is an order-upon-entry, seat-yourself, and bus-your-own-table establishment. Luckily our friends had arrived earlier than us and were able to snag a table.
The ordering steps are as follows: choose a sauce, choose a pasta, order add-ons or drinks if wanted, sit and watch the screen until your order is ready.
Holy guacamole this place is good! Although the rest of my party ordered the bolognese ragu, I decided on the mushroom and white truffle oil sauce with campanelle pasta and pork sausage. The wait for our food was about 15 minutes, but the food is freshly prepared after your order is placed. The portions are extremely generous for the price, and it's very obvious that the pasta is fresh and perfectly al dente.
I will definitely be back to try the other sauce and pasta options. AND DESSERTS! ;)","Stanley T.","Absolutely wonderful. I am so glad I came here on my Seattle trip.
FOOD
The pasta was absolutely DELICIOUS and made FRESH. My friends and I ordered 3 pasta bowls. I don't remember the pasta noodles itself but I remember ordering the Traditional Bolognese, Kale Pesto, and Mushroom & White Truffle Oil. Let me just say, the Mushroom & White Truffle was splendid and this is coming from a person that HATES mushrooms. The truffle oil wasn't overbearing and the shiitake mushrooms was an excellent compliment to the overall dish due to the umami flavor. The Bolognese came second, it was decadent but not too heavy. The Kale Pesto came in last, it was good but not my cup of tea. It had a very earthy flavor that some of you may like.
SERVICE
Exceptional service. The two girls that were working on 1/18/2020 around 7pm were extremely delightful. I loved their recommendations of which pasta went with which sauce.
RESTAURANT
Cool garden wall. Seating may be limited depending on the time. We went during dinner and it was a struggle finding seating but we eventually found seats.
CLEANLINESS
Clean. Seattle has a thing were you take the plates and utensils to the cart yourself.
PARKING
There is street parking but I walked to the restaurant.","Liz J.","Manager reached out to resolve past order issue, but Postmates wouldn't resolve it. Not to worry, we tried them again through Doordash with no issue.
Ordered 3 pasta dishes (Bolognese, mushroom truffle, Amatriciana). They were all amazing, and we found ourselves sad when we realized we ate our dinner too quickly. Definitely would recommend if you have a pasta craving.","Melody Y.","Oh my goodness the food is absolutely incredible here! The pasta is fresh, cooked to al dante perfection, and tasted amazing. I love how they offer sublime quality Italian dishes in a casual environment.
Being from Vancouver, I never thought there'd be a place like this. Wanting Italian food always means paying significantly more for a fine dining experience. Not only is Due Cucina super casual, but the prices are also affordable as well. I highly recommend adding a poached egg to your pasta! Elevates the experience to a whole other level.","Mohit N.","Went with a friend for dinner and ordered the Kale Pesto pasta and the Bean Ragout as our vegetarian options. I had never had beans with pasta before, but this place somehow made it work really well. The Kale Pesto, however, was definitely our favorite. Can't wait to try the mushroom & white truffle oil pasta next time!","Jen L.","My biggest complaint is that our pastas were NOT hot. It was a warm, but not close to hot! Lasagna was hot. We were waiting at the counter before they even called my name since I saw we were next up.
- Mushroom and white truffle with added pork sausage. This was our favorite. My sister's bowl had more sauce than ours, which I think is better as ours was a bit dry. What's with the inconsistency?
-Smoked salmon spaghetti: as you can see from my photo we had very little salmon compared to other customers' photos and the restaurant website's photos. WTH?! It was mostly noodles with a few piece of salmon and a pile of greens. Totally not what everyone else's pics look like.
- Lasagna Bolognese: I've definitely had better. Would probably choose the regular bolognese pasta over this.
- bell pepper bruschetta: too salty, but a nice change from a regular caprese
- tiramisu: delicious!
Pros: fresh pastas are cooked to perfection. Price is on point.
They do not take reservations. You order at the cashier, and then wait for them to call your name. It's really loud inside so there's board that tells you when they are ready for you to come up to the counter to get your food to carry back to your table. And the bowls/plates are heavy. You have to get your own water in the back. Also you are required to bus your own table. So what exactly did I add a tip for? I guess I should have read the other reviews. Maybe that's how they keep their prices reasonable. I was so excited to come here after being in Italy 1 month ago, and chose this restaurant for a night out with friends. With the inconsistency of salmon portion (and mushroom sauce), and failure of the proper temp of the pasta, I feel disappointed.","Artemiy B.","My meals look was awful and there is nothing special in its taste too, I'm upset
I'm gonna add some pics how their food supposed to look and how it looks in real life","Visesha K.","Surprisingly, out of everything we ate on our short trip to Seattle, this was one of the best. I really enjoyed how you could choose your own sauce and type of pasta, which is made fresh in front of your very eyes. I also liked that the sauces had a lot of vegetarian options, and there was overall a lot of good variety. The only downside is that you do have to go pick up your food from the back when it's ready and bus your tables at the end, so if you are looking for a fancy, sit-down restaurant, this is not the place. However, as a couple looking for an affordable Italian restaurant, this was the perfect spot for dinner.","Sachi E.","I'm not a huge restaurant pasta eater because I'd rather make my own at home. My friend flew from NY to visit and wanted to try this place, so we went. It's open seating so be prepared to sit with strangers and bus your own table. The service was one of the worst I've had - very short, condescending when I asked about the pasta and when I asked for a side of sausage was told ""no"" with an attitude. The actual pasta was tasty, but nothing outstanding or special. Will not be back to this place and wouldn't recommend this place over any other pasta place in Seattle.","chara c.","Disappointing. The pasta dough is homemade but machine-worked and the gluten is clearly not worked long enough because it has no chew or ""bite"" to it. My plate of pasta was also undercooked and tough. The sauces were mostly good, except the Amatriciana was a too salty and way too much cheese it was overpowering. It was more casual than expected but that was just fine, as orders were at the front and you picked up your own food. Came out pretty quickly and it wasnt too busy during weekday lunch."
"Il Terrazzo Carmine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-terrazzo-carmine-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nick P.","What can I say?
My beautiful wife took me here for my birthday this past Monday Dec 30th.
They gave us the very best table in the house for two in the corner.
Waiter and everyone else beyond our highest expectations.
Food from appetizer to desserts was spot on.
I had Osso Buco and she ordered the Veal Scallopini.
Waiter picked us a beautiful Pinot Noir as well.
I cannot say enough about the special find.
We will be back every time we visit Seattle!
Thanks to everyone for a great night we will always remember!","Isaac H.","It was a stormy night and we were less than prepared. We skipped the Lyft to save money and arrived wet. We shed our jackets, prayed for warmth, and were soon placed at the only table by the back door. Customers entered every five minutes and blasted our damp clothes with cold air all night! We never warmed up.
That aside, the food was high-caliber, with fine appetizers and stellar entrees:
- Appetizer taster: 4 stars
- Crab bruschetta: 4 stars
- Mushroom polenta: 4 stars
- Seafood ravioli: 5 stars
- Duck w/cherry: 5 stars
We left our table for a while to avoid the cold and watch the chefs do their work over the counter of the open kitchen. Their hands dashed between dozens of pans on dramatic open flames. With dishes like these, I'll always accept complimentary food to return and consider a higher rating!","Alyssa R.","The pasta was pretty basic to me. What really got me was the I've had the best duck dish I've ever had, would come back here all the time for that!
And the service was great, always checked up on us, never had my water hit the bottom.","Saumya A.","Have been there 2 times on different occasions and both times it's been awesome upscale experience. Pastas are delicious. We ordered vegetarian pesto pasta with request to chef to add some house veggies and he made it lovely. It had the right amount of pesto sauce and pine nuts. House breads are also nice.
Daily soup was lentil soup and Zuppa di cuvolo and they were good as well.","Dave K.","Great Italian Restaurant in Downtown Seattle.
This is not a family style super loud old school Italian restaurant. But if you are looking for a great spot for a work dinner / lunch or maybe a quiet spot for dinner with the wife - the food here is GREAT. Great wine selection as well.
Fried calamari - 5 star delicious. Super tender. Super flavorful. Perfect.
Caesar - 4.5 very good. The romaine is a little too green for me but they give you anchovies which I love.
Veal Scaloppini - 4.5 star very good. A great serving and the sauce was perfect.
Pasta's - 4 star. I've had a few and they are good but not blow your socks off good.
Service and bar are top notch.
I will definitely be back. I wouldn't bring the kids or a big family but if you are looking for a quiet Italian dinner with a great bottle of wine - this is it.","Wendy K.","The company I work for our Admin Day lunch here on April 24th this year. I already love this place but was even more impressed by how they handled a large party. We were originally going to have about 20 and were going to have a private space, but stuff happens and the number went down to about 12-15 they adjusted things quickly we were no longer in the private area but everything went smoothly. One of the things they do well here has always been the service. Friendly and very accommodating. My go to is always the Spaghettini Ortolano
with arugula, goat cheese, tomatoes and pine nuts. It's a nice light pasta dish perfect for spring and summer. Even if it was winter I would order it! The combination of all the ingredients just works perfectly.
Our entire table had a varied ends of orders from just soup and salad to salads with pasta entrees. Almost all of us got dessert after being presented with the beautiful dessert display. I went with the canolli which is not something I usually order but I enjoyed theirs immensely. Nice and crisp and just the right balance of everything else. Our waiter was so entertaining. We all had a wonderful time.","Jessica N.","This place has been around since the 80s and I'm just now discovering it! Hidden gem in Seattle. Traditional Italian food and all the dishes were great! Service was good and ambiance is so cute! I especially love the outside, nice place to sit on a warmer Seattle evening.
If I had to recommend one dish i guess it'd be the cioppino - broth was so flavorful and packed with fresh seafood. Very good! Also really liked the shrimp pasta with pesto.
So glad I found it! Can't wait to return.","Naveed N.","Il Terrazzo Carmine has been a long time favorite of mine in Seattle. You don't come here looking for the hip or swanky hipster foodie restaurant scene. Those culinary fads have a place of their own, but Seattle is also home to some great classic and traditional fine dining experiences. Being in the northwest, this isn't a stuffy upscale experience but holds its own to great restaurants while still maintaining a sense of comfort and familiarity.
Having introduced a friend to this place a few months prior, we tentatively planned to come in for dinner sometime early in the new year and that time finally came around.
We ordered the baked eggplant, and the Caeser salad to start while deciding on a bottle of wine. Both were great choices, and while I'm not going to deduct points here- I would like to point out to management that the eggplant dish could have come out more warm. If you're one to enjoy the creaminess of eggplant while it is still hot with a well-melted cheese, perhaps you can make that request.
For dinner, we shared the gnocchi Sorrentina, the pesto prawn fettuccine, and the roasted free-range duck. The pesto was fresh and vibrant, with prawns cooked to perfection. The Gnocchi light and flavorful, and the duck was a great choice as well, despite being torn between that and the bone-in pork chop (next time..)
Overall a fantastic experience brought to a perfect close with a couple of espressos and a creme brulee to share. Whether it is a special occasion, celebration, date night, or just another excuse for a nice dinner out- don't miss out on Il Terrazzo Carmine. Cheers!","Alecia P.","I could be bias because my boyfriend and I were celebrating our 4 year anniversary. But so far, one of my top pasta places in Seattle. From an amazing dinner to the incredible service, our evening was well spent! We both agreed that this was one of our best dining experiences we've ever had. It was definitely very memorable. We were very lucky to have a table since we reserved last minute for anniversary!
Our hostess and server were incredible. You know it's legit, when your hostess offers to take your jackets. At the end of night, she noticed taking our selfies outside and offered to take our photos. How sweet was she! Low key, she probably saw us struggling. And man, our server was so so kind and very attentive! He knew the menu from the heart.
It was a seafood night for us. For our antipasti, we started out with the Bruschetta con Granchio (dungeness crab w/ vine marinated tomatoes w/ basil oil). It was something we normally don't order, but it was very refreshing starter! I think we should've ordered something else to start since we ended up order more seafood.
- For his dish, he requested for the Linguine Alle Vongole (fresh Manila calms, chilies, garlic, parsley, & olive oil). He probably won't order this dish again because he's not a huge fan on Linguine, but he really wanted clams & he got a bunch of them!
- Me on the other hand ordered the Ravioli Pesce (large ravioli filled w/ crab, shrimp and spinach, with lobster sauce). Rich was so rich and buttery. It served well with the crab. I'm a very saucy girl, so I do wish there was more sauce since the crab didn't have too much seasoning.
At the end of the night, we were full on the amazing bread with this sweet balsamic vinegar and oil olive, topped with this creme brûlée we choose from their dessert tray! Definitely keep this restaurant on our books and coming back. Cute date spot and to dress up for!","Reilly M.","My favorite Italian in Seattle! Always get the best service, & great wine recs. Great for any special occasion! Sit in the bar if you want it to be more casual","Susan C.","Extraordinary service and food. They were prompt if not too print to serve us and get our food out as a concert awaited at Century Link.
Outstanding appetizers of calamari, prosciutto with melon. I ordered to Dungeiness crab risotto which was a large portion and really savory. Just melted in my mouth. High quality ingredients and prompt table service made this my best meal of the month!
My friend ordered osso Bucci and was very pleased.
You MUST have reservation here. Very popular especially before an event at the Link.","Karen Z.","My friend and I had a very memorable dinner here earlier this week -- hands down one of the best dining experiences I've had in Seattle. We were so impressed with the food and the service was perfect, down to the last detail.
We ordered:
- Half a dozen oysters (5/5): So good and very fresh.
- Fricasse Di Funghi Selvaggi (5/5): This absolutely blew us away. The wild mushrooms were perfectly sauteed and seasoned, and the polenta was amazing - very flavorful without being overly salty.
- Scaloppine Di Vitello Al Limone & Capperi (5/5): The waiter, seeing how indecisive I was between ordering a pasta or this entree, kindly told me they could replace the red potatoes in this dish with whichever type of pasta I liked, so I decided on a side of linguini with pesto -- which was so simple but delicious. The veal itself was nicely done (it's more like a cutlet). All the entrees were served with a side of white broccolini, which I'd never had before but looked beautiful and tasted fresh! Was truly impressed with the attentiveness to detail at Il Terrazzo Carmine.
- I can't quite remember the name of the dessert -- the ""menu"" was actually a platter of 6 options they had that night, so we choose a 3-layered cake with a side of vanilla ice cream. It was amazing! They also had creme brulee, tiramisu, cheesecake, red velvet cake, etc.
Definitely want to come back here! Beautiful ambiance, delicious food, delightful service :-)","Vaishali K.","The patio seating is superb. Cozy and beautiful. The salads were both delicious. A definite must try! However, the veg pastas did disappoint us. Both of them tasted pretty bland and the arabiatta was just spicy, no other flavor. BUT THE DESSERT TRAY WAS SUPERB! the red velvet was delicious. I would go back for the dessert tray and the salads at their patio!","Marvin G.","A good restaurant with good and pleasant service. I had hoped it would be outstanding as some of their reviews and certainly the prices suggest. The pasta dishes were fairly robust, though not super flavorful. Soups were pleasant if a little scant on ingredients. Bread was very good, though served with butter rather than olive oil and vinegar. Our server did the thing listing the dinner specials without mentioning prices, which always bugs me (it seems manipulative; you have to ask the price and feel like a cheapskate, or order and hope for the best while feigning wealthy nonchalance, or just avoid the specials altogether).
Tends more toward art food than a solid meal, not quite in the ""eat before you go"" category but leaning that way. Noise level was quite tolerable. A little too much reliance on salt in the dishes, though not terrible.
I'd go back but would not go out of my way to.","Aaron P.","Seattle is now known for its Italian! Thank you for the perfect birthday! From the wine list to the sweets! Bravo.","Steve L.","So very good!
We stopped in Friday evening before a show for dinner. I started at the bar and had a drink while awaiting the arrival of my better half. I talked to the bartender and he offered to go back to the restaurant and see if he might get us a table. As luck would have it they had one table left and we got it.
From start to finish everything was first rate and amazingly tasty. Our server was attentive and skilled - exactly what I look for to help guide us in a new place.
Prices were appropriate for such an extremely high caliber restaurant. We both agreed that this was one of the very best dining experiences we've ever had.
I'd recommend this place for your next special occasion.
Reservations are advised - you may not be as lucky as we were.","Melissa L.","Made reservations for an Italian dinner on a Saturday night and it exceeded my expectations.
Its located in the back of the lobby of Merrill Place. We arrived on time and stepped inside to the Host stand. They gave us the option of inside or outside and we opted to be seated outside since it was a beautiful, warm, summer evening.
The patio has chandeliers, fire pit, white linens, candlelights and fresh flowers on the tables and pillows at my seat. It was beautiful.
Service was very good and attentive. Water and bread was brought out quickly to the table.
We started with Prosciutto con Melone. Cantaloup is in season and it was delivered ripe with imported parma prosciutto. Very Good.
Ordered a 1/2 dozen of the oysters of the day. These were fresh and served at the perfect temperature and with a mignonette. The mignonette was all that was needed to balance the saltiness.
For my entree, I ordered the Risotto of the Day. Served w/Wagyu and Gorgonzola. The wagyu was not as tender/buttery as I expected and the gorgonzola was mild. I had hoped for stronger flavors. However, the risotto was prepared well.
We were too full to consider dessert.
Good cocktail & wine selection; started with a cocktail and ended with a chianti.
Service was attentive and spot on.
Borderline 5 star experience; a repeat visit may bring it up to 5 stars.","Luis G.","We really enjoyed our dishes and are definitely coming back. I ordered Bistecca, my wife Cioppino Nostrano.
The steak was tender and cooked to perfection, delicious.","Tanya D.","Beautiful atmosphere. Amazing selection of food and wine. Service was beyond excellent! Eric was our waiter. He was pleasant, knowledgeable & went out of his way to make everything perfect for us.","Katie Y.","Yummm, I love Il Terrazzo Carmine. We came here on a weekday around dinnertime and had failed to make a reservation in advance. Luckily, they said they could seat us if we were out within an hour and a half - of course, we agreed.
We started with the caprese and the burrata, and although the portions were a bit small to split between 4 people, the dishes were spectacular. Service was a little bit slow, as was the food - we had kept up our end of the bargain by being ready to order almost as soon as we sat down and went over the 90m mark. Luckily, the host came over and told us that he had sorted out things on his end and we were free to stay as long as we liked.
I highly, highly recommend the fettuccine al pesto. The prawns it come with are a healthy portion, and the noodles are clearly homemade as they almost melt in your mouth. It's flavorful and a decent sized portion. This place does feel a bit stuffy, but I think that's the vibe they're going for. We had just came from work so we all had our work backpacks/bags with us and felt a little out of place having to find somewhere to place them, as the restaurant is a little crowded with tables. Still, if you're a pasta lover then this place is one I'd highly recommend for you."
"Cortina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cortina-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Hannah D.","We had this on our list of places to go when we have a babysitter and finally got to go! We were pretty dressed up because it looked nice in photos. Most people there were very casual and had just got done shopping. Several families had little kids. I realize now that we could've just brought ours! Oh well!
I had the modern love cocktail to start. It had a super herby and interesting taste with an orchid on top. Very pretty for photos! But let's be honest, the whole restaurant is photo worthy and I'm a huge sucker for aesthetics. For dinner I had the rigatoni and it was a very generous portion. I could've probably saved half for a second dinner! It was amazing, like all Ethan Stowell food. My husband got the hanger steak and it was a VERY small portion, about 5 bites of steak with fries. He said it was very good, but not worth the $35 price tag. Can't wait to go back!","Allison T.","Service: To start off, we made a reservation ahead of time through Yelp, but when we arrived ON TIME they said they had no record of our reservation. It wasn't a huge problem, though, because we were a party of two and they had plenty of seating open. We were seated at about 7:35pm and ordered at 7:45pm. We only ordered one appetizer and two entrees--the appetizer arrived about five minutes after ordering, but we did not receive the entrees for another 40 minutes. For a restaurant that was probably only about 40% occupied, it felt like an excessive wait. Also not sure if this was significant or not, but one thing we noticed is that each time someone came to take our order/check in on us, it was a different person each time.
Food: The food was actually pretty good. We got the focaccia for appetizer, and the gnocchi and the rigatoni.
Ambiance: Simple and elegant.
In fairness, I would give 3.5 stars, but the wait time for two pastas was actually pretty ridiculous. Even with the good food, I probably won't be back.","Scott S.","Cortina was a solid Italian establishment with a bit of an upscale vibe. It's in the ground floor of an office building, you can probably imagine exactly what it looks like.
We went as a group of 6 and shared a lot of appetizers such as squash and crostini. Then for dinner had a meat sauce pasta and a chicken dish. Both were pretty good.
Service was good as well. Solid restaurant if you're in the area, nothing I'd go too far out of my way for.","Irene W.","We came here for our friend's birthday and the experience here was amazing! We had a group of 10 and we made a reservation and were seated quickly! The ambience in here is very nice. It's dim but not too dark. The interior was simple with lots of tan wood. I had a lot of fun here, maybe it was the company, but the waiters/staff were super respectful and really just let us socialize while making sure our water cups were full.
The food here is really delicious. I'm really glad we went with a pasta/italian place. I ordered the linguini nero but EVERYTHING looks amazing. My second choice would have been the carbonara. It looked so delicious. The linguini was black noodles with lobster. It was slightly spicy but it complimented so well with the dish. I really enjoyed the pasta. I would absolutely recommend the linguini nero. Not only did it look really unique and cool, it tasted unique and yummy!
I'd recommend this place to everyone! I came with no expectations and left really happy.","Frank D.","Excellent prices at happy hour from 4-6PM on a Sunday after the matinee at the 5th Ave Theater and they give a discount for season subscribers. 3 small plates and 2 pastas were more than enough. Beef tartare was excellent and the fish brushceta has a strong smokey delicious flavor. Fast responsive service. Clean modern decor. Very comfortable upscale atmosphere. Regular menu is more expensive but food is definitely worth it.","Sophia K.","I came here on my anniversary weekend with my boyfriend because I was craving pasta. The appetizers here looked sooooo good and the dining atmosphere looked very modern and simple -- both wins in my book.
Upon arriving, the reservation I made through yelp fell through but fortunately we were able to get seated right away. My bf and I ordered a TON of things, our server (who was super nice and friendly) even joked around thinking we couldn't finish. If I remember correctly, we ordered the bruschetta, beef tartare, fries, and two pastas and drinks. The wrong bruschetta came out so we actually had two at our table. While I can say the appetizers were absolutely amazing, the pasta as okay at best. At the time, I considered coming back just for the appetizers.
Now why do I give my experience three stars? I woke up at 5am the next morning with food poisoning and again 3 hours later throwing up everything I had in my stomach. I've never had food poisoning before so it was absolutely brutal. Suffice it to say, my boyfriend ate all the same things I did and he was totally fine. The only difference was that I ate the carbonara and he had the rigatoni.
Although having a shitty experience afterward (literally), I would recommend this restaurant to others but not entirely sure I would come back.","Kate N.","I always have crave for pasta and keep looking for new places to try . It's funny that @cortina was never in my list and I just tried it by coincidence. And I'm IN LOVE . Due' Cucina was used to be my top choice but now I must say that @cortina is the best!!!
.
I tried Bucatini (plenty of meatballs), Rigatoni ( my most favorite ), Linguine Nero (with Dungeness crab). All of them were super delicious! Perfectly cooked and seasoned, al dente pasta and good portion . I would loveee to come back again!
.
TIPS: the Linguine Nero is delicious but it tastes a little more sour compared to other pastas so you should try to eat this first before other dishes for the best taste!
.
P/s: their interior is beautiful and spacious as well!!! Everything is just perfect .","Dhanashree A.","This place is one of the few which manages to have a slightly casual vibe inspite of such a classy decor. The place is really well lit and is ideal for groups.
Their menu is short which I really like. The food is really good as well. I went with a large group and was able to get reservations for Friday night easily. They don't have parking but you can always find street parking close by. I got to try their linguine Nero, gnocchi and my husband got their burger. For appetizers we got their focaccia, white bean bruschetta and their fries. The appetizers were decent. Fires were a little over seasoned and the focaccia would have been better if it was warm. Loved their bruschetta though, many textures and flavors. Their gnocchi was delicious, creamy, pillowy and cheesy. Most of our group got this and really liked it. I got their linguine Nero and really liked it. It's just a tad too sour. I think the peppers is what makes it so, if I knew I would have got mine without the peppers. The crab and the pasta itself is delicious though! My husband loved his burger. Perfect cook, perfect flavor.
The drinks are unique. They do serve usual versions of the drinks if you ask though. I tried their grapefruit mule. It's a little bitter, but if that's your thing you would love it. Service is on point! Our server was really helpful and patient. Would go back to try more!","Jen K.","Party of three - my coworkers and I pop in for a midweek lunch at 11:10AM. We are greeted and asked if we have a reservation. There is a football fields length of empty tables in front of us. We say no. The gal steps away to confer with someone else. We are then escorted to the back of the restaurant and seated at a lounge table with slouchy chairs because ""this is what wE have available"". Really? There are at least 4 open booths and 20 + open tables around us. The tables gradually filled in but by the time we left there were still empty seats. So annoying and rude. Food was fine.","Marissa E.","Came here for restaurant week and it was so delicious! I need to come back and get the zeppoles again, they were dreamy. Would love to come back another time and try more dishes. Only thing is the service was super slow. Everyone was very kind and helpful but just had to wait a long time to order and between courses.","Melody L.","This is a nice Italian restaurant for a pre or post movie meal since it's near both Regal Meridian and AMC Pacific Place. I came here on a Friday night and did not need a reservation to sit at one of the tables near the bar. There weren't many people dining there, so the atmosphere was kind of quiet.
I had the bucatini and enjoyed it. It came with plenty of meatballs that I thought were just a tad dry, but the pasta was delightful. I was full by the end of the meal, so the portion size was acceptable by my standards. I paid around $30 including tax and tip, which is not too bad for a plate of fresh pasta.","Jessica C.","Happened upon here during restaurant week which means they limit their menu. However, their food is great. Partner got the bacon burger and loved it. He never accepts bacon in his burger but they did their so fantastically crispy, he let it slide. Also even though he ordered well done patty, it was still juicy. Less so from the meat and more so from the amazing flavors, like the special sauce and thinly sliced tomatoes.
I got the prosciutto as an appetizer with the carbonara pasta. The prosciutto was super soft with a cheese shaving on top. Would have liked a bit more cheese but it's OK. The pasta came with the yolk intact, allowing me to pierce it and spread across the fresh noodles.","Jennifer M.","Elijah was a tremendous waiter! Very attentive and made our experience excellent! Top notch service! Will definitely be coming back!","Emily J.","I love noodles. This place had been on my bookmarks for a long time. I am not always in downtown Seattle where it would make visiting this place convenient but luckily this past week, I was. Plus my friend said it was one of the noodle places he really likes.
We walked in around 7pm on a Thursday night. Most tables were full, people before us had reservations, a few people in the waiting area, but lucky us, we got a table.
First things first, we ordered drinks. I ordered the Blackberry Margarita. It was refreshing and very appealing to the instagrammer eye. I wouldn't say you could easily tell there was alcohol in it but it was very tasty and easy to drink down quickly.
For food, I could not decide between the Uni Butter Spaghetti or the Carbonara. I asked the waiter for his recommendation and he said definitely the Carbonara with no hesitation. That made my indecisiveness go away and easily choose the Carbonara. My friend ordered the Uni Butter Spaghetti so I still ended up getting to try that as well. Both of those pastas were super good.
You may think it is crazy but we also ended up ordering an extra pasta dish to share. It was the Bucatini. Consider it normal since we did not get an appetizer. Normally I am a fan of anything Bucatini and the pasta was good but the sauce wasn't really anything special and the meatballs were try and kinda flavorless.
3/4 of the dishes being very good would still be considered a successful dinner in my opinion. I really wanted to try the Linguine Nero but the reviews made it sound like I would be disappointed so maybe another time.
If you are reading for the menu on their website, know it changes. Some of the pastas stay the same but they change some in and out. 10/10 would go here again.","Edward S.","Cortina is the latest restaurant from Ethan Stowell and I was glad to find it lived up to the standards of his other restaurants. It is a pretty large space and is nice and bright.
This is an Italian restaurant with a great menu. Service was superb--our server Elmelia was terrific. I started with the Buffalo mozzarella and the Brussels sprouts. The mozzarella dish was heavenly--the cheese tasted wonderful and was complemented beautifully with some sliced ham and pistachios (along with a few pieces of bread). The Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly.
Next I had the parma pizza. The crust was a little soggy, but the toppings were excellent, particularly the prosciutto. It comes with a generous amount of arugula.
The last dish was my favorite--the fontina ravioli. The fresh pasta was great, but the cheese and truffle flavor was absolutely exquisite. This is a really good dish.","Brittany I.","Finally got to try this newer Ethan Stowell restaurant. It was fairly easy to make a reservation here for a large party during a week night, even the night before, which was great.
Overall, our dining experience, from service to food to ambiance, was very solid but nothing super stand out.
As for food, we tried a bunch of items but my favorites were the Prosciutto di Parma (SO smooth!) and Gnocchi al Telefonica (has a bit of a kick!). The Linguine Nero was a disappointment unfortunately. I was optimistic after reading reviews but after eating it, the flavor was really one-dimensional and lacking for me. There was also maybe only 2 small pieces of lobster. The breadcrumbs gave it a nice texture though.
My colleague had the Tonarelli Carbonara, which was good but not your traditional carbonara. This version is actually a bit lighter and less rich than most carbonaras I've eaten. Sometimes they are so rich you can't eat much. That isn't the case here. However, the pasta is thicker so that will fill you up quickly!","Meagan W.","Honestly the food was really good, but due to the service I don't think I'd come again.
For a nice restaurant we were pretty disappointed with service. We made the mistake of saying ""no"" when asked if we had a show to get to- and proceeded to sit for 45 minutes waiting for our food while two other tables beside us sat down, and received two courses in the time we waited for one. We had a reservation and we weren't in a rush, but a 2 hour meal when everyone else was in and out in under an hour was disappointing. We are fairly certain our order got pushed behind EVERYONE going to a show- one or two in a rush wouldn't have been a big deal, but that was a really long time! Also, no one even noticed it had been that long- not even a ""sorry for the bit of a wait"".
But the food was good! We got the burratta, bruschetta, and ravioli and al were really tasty! I'd say average to smal portion size which is fine because they're all pretty rich food I'm not sure I could have eaten more of it (or I was full on water from my free time, you decide).
All in all, maybe it was our server, maybe it was an extra busy night? Not sure but I likely wouldn't be back or recommend to a friend based on our experience.","Angelina T.","We came here because this showed up on like every must go list. The interior is pleasant and spacious. Our server, Tom, went above and beyond; he was incredibly friendly and checked on us a few times. When I booked a reservation I notified Cortina that it was our anniversary and they gave us a surprise of two glasses of champagne at the end of our meal! We had three dishes: funghi pizza, potato gnocchi, and the special of the day which was king crab spaghetti.
Both the pizza and the gnocchi were great 4/5 stars. Everything was so filling my boyfriend and I felt like the both of us would've been full off of one of the three dishes if we shared it.
My only complaint is that the king crab pasta was super sour. It was unpleasant to eat and the white wine drowned out any potential flavour. It's a 1/5.","Beth s.","I am super stingy with my stars, but Cortina deserves this review. I'm in Seattle on Business, staying across the street at the Sheraton... The restaurant is across the street. Lucky me, showed up at 5:30 and it was happy hour. The HR menu is amazing with great full size options. Had the Burrata with olives for $8 and it was delicious and a large serving. Then had the pasta with pepper and parmesan $12. Super simple, clean and flavorful. Generous portion, I could only eat about half of it. Also, the service was perfect. Super attentive, without being overbearing. Highly recommend you check this place out.. Final thought, love the atmosphere. Modern and comfortable with a huge bar which is key when your traveling on your own!","Katie S.","I love the appetizers and drinks! Especially the torta and prosciutto. Pizza is great too. The service was really disappointing, including from the manager. My friend asked for her bill three times and was snapped at (everyone around her got their bill without asking for it so not sure why she had to repeat herself after waiting at least 10 minutes). Hoping my next experience will have better service because I really enjoy the happy hour and the atmosphere."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Natasha G.","This might be my favorite lunch spot in all of Seattle. I wish they were open for longer hours! It's such an interesting find, and I was lucky that I had a coworker bring me here during my first week on the job.
The employees are incredible. They are quick, remember faces, and are relentlessly friendly. You can tell that there are regulars who sit at the bar, who just treasure the experience of coming here. It's a really small menu and venue, but it's definitely part of the charm.
The ingredients are fresh, and they experiment with new flavors - all of them were good. I always went ""from the Garden,"" and was delighted each time.","Ashley K.","Utterly fantastic and a wonderful showcase of the market.
Came here for lunch recently with two others. We each had a different item and all of us loved it. I had the Ocean, someone else got the Farm and the third got the simpler pasta with marinara, parm and basil. Each one was amazing. The open kitchen gives you a front row to watch your food cooked while you wait.
The Ocean was a really well-spiced dish. Pasta in all three was cooked absolutely perfectly, tender but toothsome still.
The service was amazing. Everyone was very friendly, and they run that place like a Swiss watch. Wonderful to see a kitchen running so smoothly and efficiently.
When you get your food, you can cram in the upstairs if there are seats, or join the mixed market vibes of the eating area down the stairs (just be careful carrying your plate!). Note, if you're getting wine (which I wanted to, but alas it was lunch on a weekday and I didn't want to fall asleep at work) you gotta stay upstairs to eat.
Would definitely come back for an early, early dinner with too much wine for a romantic market date night.","Courtney D.","Great (hidden) Italian spot in the market! My husband has been here for lunch a bunch and I finally got to check it out. I got the ""From the Garden"" meal and it was very good. Honestly, everything on the menu looked delicious, and from what my husband says, it is.
It's one of those casual spots that has the food speak for itself. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!","Frank L.","Pasta Casalinga continues to dazzle with great value and great tasting pasta dishes.
I am more of a carnivore so the ""From the Garden"" was a miss for me. It was fine, though I felt garden meant more veggies and there were none.
From the Farm is solid. Could use more meat though! Still love it no matter what. Tasty, filling, a tad rich. Can I request 10% less richness? Then it would be perfect!
From the Ocean, a visual delight on top of taste. They speak for themselves. Again, just a tad rich near the end, but that ain't stopping me from finding any excuse to make a special trip to enjoy late/early dinners!
See you soon!!!","Anne M.","Finally got the opportunity to visit this little pasta store in Pike Place market. It is tucked away upstairs so you have to go looking for it if you want some of its delicious pasta. I decided to order the From the Farm option which was a pork-based pasta dish, while my friend got the From the garden option which had pumpkin. Both dishes were obviously prepared very fresh and tasted delicious, and the wait was not long at all!
The store itself is pretty small but we were able to get some small seating on the bar near the kitchen. They also sell alcohol so we were able to get a glass of champagne and Rose to go with our dishes. Both paired nicely with our orders.
I would say that it is a very reasonably priced plate of food especially for lunchtime with the dishes ranging from $11-$15. I would definitely come back here to try more seasonal options when in the Pike Place market area.","Amy V.","In love with this place! The pasta is amazing and made when you order. We didn't have to wait too long but expect it to be busy because it will be during lunch time! That day I got the From The Ocean option and it was amazing! I know they have already switched up their menu so this will not be there now but I love how simple their menu is and that you will always get something new. The people are so nice and the flavor is so good! I will have to come back soon!","Madison S.","Pasta Casalinga is a small, underestimated pasta only food stop inside a small court within Pike Place market. You walk up to the counter and there's a list of 4 or 5 pasta dishes to choose from. I love this because it tells me that their selection is small (which means in my head, high quality). It didn't disappoint!
The pasta was warm, the sauce was tasty the overall dish was drool worthy. Perfect for a chilly winter day. They had seafood, meat, vegetable, white sauce and traditional pomodoro tomatoe sauce options available. Seating is limited, though I had no trouble finding a couple of counter spots at 12:05 on a Sunday.
I ordered the rigatoni with Vennison Rague (meaty and warm) and my friend ordered the Pomodoro (fresh and tasty).
So good. I'll go back for sure.","Annie W.","Perfect to the T. I was never a huge fan of pasta until Casalinga and Corvo. Thank goodness this place is open Tuesday - Sunday from 11am to 6pm! I love that it's quick and easy like Corvo. They let you know the selection pasta used for each dish which is helpful. Ordering is quick and simple then you grab a seat by the bar and get to people watch since you are next to Pike's! The wait is never too long since the food comes out immediately always tasting 10/10!! I love this place and always recommend my friends that haven't been. It's such a great lunch to stop at by Pikes & you don't get the crowd.","Katie C.","TLDR small menu, small location, big flavor.
Location:
Smallish area that seats about 15 people maximum and about 30 seconds walking into the pike place market entrance with daily dozen donuts.
Food:
Looks like it's a small rotating menu and if I lived around here, I would definitely come to try their new dishes often. I had the from the farm option with boar ragout. Pasta was cooked aldente, sooo perfect and yummy.
Service:
Super fast, even when crowded so just order and a seat will open up when your dish comes.","Hari K.","YUM. just YUM! i brought my friends from Boston here and they all agreed with me, it was such amazing pasta. I had something with nuts in it. the pasta texture was unreal! I love that the menu is constantly changing with the seasons it keeps things so fresh.","Albert L.","Featuring quality pastas at incredible prices, Pasta Casalinga is perhaps the best bang for the buck I've ever had stateside for Italian food.
Pasta Casalinga focuses on four specific pasta dishes categories such as from the sea, from the garden, from the ocean, and a ""everyday"" choice with each dish costing $11-$13.
When we went, we had dishes like the Garden Beet Pasta w/ burrata, and the hearty Lasagna alla Boscaiola, all of which were not too rich or unnecessarily overwhelming with taste.","Kevin N.","A true hidden gem within Pike Place Market. Looking for top-notch pasta without all of the fine-dining hassle? Look no further.
I visited on a Saturday afternoon after seeing this pop up on my yelp home page over and over again. Luckily, despite Pike Place being as busy as it always is on the weekend, there wasn't much of a crowd once I ventured off into the little outlet where this spot is located.
I ordered a ""from the farm,"" which contained some flavorful sausage and mushroom, all enveloped in a fresh pappardelle and olive oil and topped with some salty parmesan. To be honest, I did have pretty high expectations, and I'm glad that they were met upon my first bite. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the sausage and parmesan provided some nice salt while the mushroom's earthy flavor rounded out the dish well. Being that the sauce was oil-based, it didn't feel too heavy like cream-based pastas tend to be. Also, the portion sizes are deceptively perfect. At first glance, it's a small serving, but when you finish eating it, you'll realize that you'll be just full without feeling bloated - I love that.
The staff were all super nice - one of them even checked on me to make sure I was doing ok, despite there not being any actual waiter service. The are some bar seats in the immediate vicinity, and the sunflowers on the tables brings a smell that actually transports you to the countryside. If no seats are there, there are also some tables in the general area that any Pike Place visitor can sit at. Pro tip: BUS YOUR OWN DISHES - there's a bin across from the register where you put your dirty plates/silverware.
For the quality of pasta here, I'm so used to paying upwards of $20, yet the fact that I paid less than $15 means that the value here is hard to beat if you're looking for quality pasta. I'll be sure to come back to try other menu items.","Jordan N.","We decided to stop in this quieter place in like place that had spaces to sit, and time to think about our order. The server seemed like she was rushing us even though there was no line, so that left a little to be desired.
I ordered the From The Ocean ($13) which came with sockeye salmon, zucchini, olives, capers and caserecce noodles. The noodles we're nice and creamy, and the cherry tomatoes were an awesome sweetness to cut through the dish. The olives weren't too strong tasting, and the pasta tasted incredibly fresh. Only complaint is that i didn't get much salmon in my dish. Wished for a better proportion.
I would come here again for a safe choice in pike place because I have been to spots in the market that serve too little for too much. It wasn't anything amazing, but it was a solid choice for the overwhelming options in the market.","Angie A.","Wow that was lovely! We live in Seattle but love playing tourists and visiting Pike Place market on a Sunday sometimes. This place was quite hidden from the main touristy part of the market. We found it accidentally. It was so charming and reminding us of Europe so we couldn't help but try it! We had been eating our way through the market at this point and decided to share just 1 dish. We ordered spaghetti with pomodoro sauce. It was soooooo yummy! Perfect amount of food. Pasta cooked a bit too al dente for me but nice and chewy. We didn't know we could add ricotta and or speck to the dish. We will definitely do that next time. It was late lunch but the place was quite busy. Limited seating but we didn't have problems finding space for 2. I was excited and asking them few questions. Staffs were friendly. Dishes came out in good amount of time. Sit at the little corner bar if you enjoy seeing the actions in the kitchen.
Overall a lovely fresh home made pasta restaurant. Menus are simple but delish! We cannot wait to come back!","Nam N.","What a nice hidden gem for authentic pasta dishes. I've frequented Pike Place Market all my life and I've seen Pasta Casalinga tucked away in the southern most part of the market - but for some reason, never felt compelled to go. I think a part of me thought ""it's probably touristy and/or overly expensive.""
Last week - I walked by again but this time - my gut said, ""just try it."" I had the pasta pomodoro and the casalinga lasagna. The pomodoro's sauce was extremely light, the pasta perfectly al dente. It was filling yet, light. Such a simple dish full over flavor.
The Casalinga Lasagna... this was a dream i never knew i wanted to have come true. Im used to the americanized ""loaded with ground beef and processed cheese and smother it in tomato sauce"" type of lasagna. Casalinga gave me a taste of elegance and desire. Smooth and silky pasta, sweet peas and mushrooms for contrast and flavor. The pork sausage so delicatley seasoned for you to actually taste meat and not pure salt. The creamy smoothness of the bechamel sauce paired with the fullness of the grated fresh parmesean - it was a symphony of flavors that was dancing in my mouth.
Few and far between do I eat something that simply pauses time for a brief moment. And makes me feel at home, it was like the moment when Ego (the food critic) took a bit of ratatouille in the movie Ratatouille - and despite me being Asian, i had that same sense of ""takes me back home"" feeling when I eat this lasagna. Its so delicious!","Jeff R.","If you're in the area around Pikes Market and you want amazingly fresh (aka- hand made to order) pasta, then look no further than Pasta Casalinga.
The location is a little harder to find, as you have to venture out of the main halls of the market and find your way into an interior portion of the market buildings.
Once you find it, it might not seem like much, but the humble walk-up counter will provide to be some of the best pasta you have. There is limited seating, so don't be surprised if you have to sit close to someone along the bar, or have to walk a little to find some seating back closer to the main market area.
No matter where you eat it, do yourself a favor and track down this hidden gem and enjoy some fresh pasta.","Morgan J.","Great fast yet nice dining option in the market I had no idea about until today! Only 5 options for pasta, but don't worry, there is a seafood, meat, and vegetarian option! It looks like they rotate the menu often, other than the pomodoro and lasagna, which stay the same. And you'll be glad. The radiatore was good but the lasagna was great. There is plenty of counter seating or if you have a larger group you can take them to tables down one level to seating there. You order at the counter. They serve alcohol. So cute!","Willy M.","Came by for lunch with a few buds, one of them is a finicky eater, told him to suck it up and deal with it and branch out a little, it's pasta for crying out loud!
Anyways, this pasta spot is located inside Pike Place Market, it's around the corner from DeLaurenti, it's where Honest Biscuits used to be, near the atrium entrance.
Friendly greetings as we walked up, they have about 4-6 pastas available, it's a rotating menu so don't fall in love with it as it can be more of a hit & run depending on seasonal ingredients.
I decided to choose the ""From the Ocean"" option which was sable fish with paccheri pasta, red peppers, olives, capers and this olive oil sauce. It was very good! The paccheri pasta was great, love large tube pasta! I rarely think of adding fish to pasta, I did once add canned tuna to mac & cheese when I was in college. The sable fish in this dish was tasty, went well with all the other ingredients and overall very delicious!
There are a few other options like a sausage pasta dish, a vegetarian pasta dish and their popular lasagna. I think Ill try that next time.
Portions aren't large nor small, it's actually quite perfect, we left comfortably full and satisfied. Prices are about $10 -$13 depending on which pasta dish you choose. Staff is friendly, everything is cooked to order, fresh pasta for each dish, there's stools and a ledge for you to eat at but just around the corner from them, there are community tables you can sit at, we just took our dishes down there to eat. It's no major physical feat to return your bowl back to their bins, so be sure to do that.
We all enjoyed our pasta dishes, even the finicky eater friend wants to come back again, you're welcome bud!
Great pasta place, definitely coming back again!","Marissa S.","This has to be my new favorite restaurant currently. Some of the best pasta I've had in my life and it is so ridiculously affordable, you're losing money not buying it! I will be back. And back again. A lot.","Katie K.","As a pasta aficionado, I'm not easily impressed. I was eager to try Pasta Casalinga after reading ""lunch only, made fresh daily, while supplies last"" on their website. We were greeted with big smiles from the staff. My two friends and I each ordered a separate meal and all tasted a bite of one another's. I can confidently say, you won't find a bad thing on the menu. I'm already planning my next trip. It is a must go if you're in the market area."
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Julia A.","My favorite cuisine is Italian food so my husband and I like to venture out to try all the Italian restaurants there are in Seattle. This restaurant is in a really hidden location (it's the right most business in the plaza) and there's no well lit/big sign at all in the front to help you locate the restaurant as you drive here. But note that the small parking lot IS available to park at when you eat here!
We ordered the Bruschetta to start - lovely! It contained lots of tomatoes so that was a very pleasant start. For dinner, I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara and my husband ordered the Lasagna. When you order your entrees....order one between two people. Don't say I didn't warn you!! The portion size is GINORMOUS (see pics) and you definitely want to leave room for dessert. Unless you want lots of leftovers (I mean that is not a bad thing), then split an entree. :P The actual entrees were absolutely DELICIOUS. For dessert, we ordered the Canoli - light and YUMMY!! We were disappointed there wasn't Panna Cotta on the dessert menu but we got over that pretty quickly. :P
Highly recommend trying this restaurant! It's a hidden gem. :)","Cindy I.","Wish it had nicer atmosphere in the restaurant but it's full of old school fluorescent lights dimmed with decorative covers. So we took the food to go. The chicken Marsala was more bland than we like. We both felt the chicken Parmesan was very good and would go back for that again. Meatballs and spaghetti was a meal we would order again too.
Don't forget the garlic knots are great!","Megha B.","This is one of my favorite hole in the wall restaurant in Seattle.
The food is very authentic and amazing. I love the garlic knots, spaghetti aglio e olio, harvest gnocchi and the pizza. The house red is usually pretty decent.
I like the server and manager at this restaurant, they are both really friendly and it's always a great time dining here.
I will continue eating here!","Mindful M.","Absolute hidden gem. Every time we come I'm stunned at how good the food is for the price, and how laid back it is! Non-pretentious, incredible homemade and authentic food, cozy atmosphere. I'm always shocked this place isn't packed any time we come in, but on the rare occasion it is they're always happy to suggest takeout which is just as nice.","Clay B.","What a wonderful place to sit and have delicious homemade Italian food, we were waited on by the chef.
She makes everything in house and wonderful! Higher recommend the Lamb Ragout sandwich, the lunch menu is small, but they have a much larger menu for dinner that starts at 4pm. Lunch is from 11:am- 2:00pm, get there early as it is a small restaurant but very nice.","Kathy A.","I definitely found my new favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle! This place is perfect. You would never notice it from the street view and when you walk in you're immediately thinking ""wait? really? this place does good italian food?"" It is a quintessential hole in the wall restaurant without any bells and whistles on ambiance but the food and service far exceed expectations! Portions are large and the price points are hard to beat. The farro salad is massive and has huge chunks of goat cheese. Quite tasty! The arancini are hearty and topped with plenty of tomato sauce. The harvest gnocchi was divine! Rich, cheesy but still a nice light pasta dish. Our server was lovely as well and the food came out rather quick! I can't wait to return!","Jennifer T.","Came here last Friday with a friend and we indulged in the ""Family Style"" meal, where you choose what you pay (suggested $20-50 pp) and the chef curates a multi-course dinner for the table. Per our server's recommendation, we did $35 to bring us from appetizer to dessert, and this was no joke best $35 I've ever spent at a restaurant!! The quantity and quality of food served here would have easily been $60+ pp at other restaurants. So happy I've found this hidden gem!! Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great value, authentic Italian comfort food.
More on the food:
- Appetizer (5/5...peep my photo to see the full spread!!): A few of my favorites were the caesar salad w/ crab meat, steamed clams in white wine, deep fried gnocchi, tomatoes & burrata, and toasted baguette w/ this amaaazing pistachio spread. I probably could've been full off just the first course! But of course, I paced myself in anticipation for the other dishes... :)
- Pesto tortellini with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes (5/5): This was easily the most decadent and well-made tortellini I've ever had! The pasta itself had the perfect amount of bite/chewiness, the pesto was so fresh/aromatic, and the creamy goat cheese + the sweet-tartness of the sun-dried tomato made every bite taste like a little piece of heaven. I'm typically not blown away by tortellini but this dish packed so much flavor!
- Steak w/ roasted asparagus (4/5): The steak cut like butter and the asparagus was perfectly roasted and seasoned...it was a simple dish but was cooked really well and complemented the bold flavors in our other courses. Dessert:
- Cheesecake w/ chocolate salami (4/5): Loved how the cheesecake was so fluffy/light! Also enjoyed nibbling on the salami-shaped dark chocolates pieces with walnuts.
Our server was super helpful and friendly -- he consistently went out of his way to make sure we were enjoying our food and our water cups were never empty. The restaurant itself is modestly sized and modestly decorated...the ambiance is nothing to write home about, but the incredible food, service, and value made Aglio E Olio a 5/5 experience for me!","Nikhil T.","This is a hidden gem. One of the handful places in Seattle that can serve a delicious main course under $20. We have been here twice and both times found the food to be delicious and the portion sizes large (you're guaranteed to have leftovers). The olive oil and fresh bread is heavenly. The pesto pasta is great as well. The music and decor is quirky Italian. The server is fantastic to talk to.","Jon H.","So far this is my favorite Italian place in the city. The bruschetta is delicious, as is the parm and practically anything you can order!
My advice: come early in the day before the evening rush or call in a reservation, the restaurant is very small and fills up quickly (literally maybe 5 or 6 tables)","Travis G.","I am so happy to be so close to this place! There are a ton of great items on the menu, but I keep going back to the strip steak with the gorgonzola gnocchi. So good and a great price. Also, the bruschetta is a standout. But really everything I've had is good - we've tried nearly every item on the menu.","Joe S.","Amazing. From the outside it doesnt look like much, but the food here is tied for my favorite Italian place. The staff is very personable and welcoming.
My go-to is the 4 cheese pasta, I don't know if I would consider it my favorite dish ever, but as the time I'm writing this, I'm having a hard time thinking of anything that I could definitively say tops it.","Amanda E.","The best italian food ever! Also the best service I can get on this new year day! I had the seafood rigatoni with a lemon zest alfredo sauce. Mighty delicious!","Jeff B.","4.5 stars.
What a surprise. Our son wanted to have birthday dinner here, so the five of us went on a Saturday evening.
FOOD: 4.5 stars. We had $35 per person dinner, leaving the chef to decide the contents. This included for the vegan among us. Excellent value. Several appetizers (green salad, cold cuts, olives, mozzarella, bruschetta, artichokes, etc), pasta meat dish, lamb chops (and equivalents for the vegan). Followed by dessert. The bday boy received a free tiramisu - heavenly; the rest of us had chocolate gelato with fruit - excellent!
We also had a carafe of house red wine from Montepulciano.
SERVICE: 5.0 stars. The gentleman and lady servers worked hard to ensure we were very satisfied.
AMBIANCE: 4.0 stars. Nicely done, attractive (yet simple) interior.
TIP: Make reservations, at least for a Sat evening. They were fully booked the evening we dined. Quite a few people came in for take-out.","Jim P.","Oh My!
Came for lunch, and if you blink you may drive right past this place. Nothing fancy about the building or the interior for that matter (never mind the greasy floors) but man they can put out some dang nice foods.
We had the porchetta sandwich, the mortadella sandwich, rigatoni bowl, and an alfredo bowl (with porchetta). The sandwiches are huge, great bread, fillings super hot and plentiful. I also love the gardenia mix.
The pastas come with ceasar salad and I garlic knot that you wish you had about a dozen more of.
Prices are very reasonable, now if I could only convince them to open a place in West Seattle my live would be complete.","S S.","This place is a gem. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The food is among the best Italian in the city. I don't come here as often as I would like because, well, weight. I always eat waaaayyyyy too much when I'm here. The hole in the wall aspect is nice and cozy, but I do wish they had an upmarket version as well so I could come here as a night out.
Also, I wish they would deliver with someone other than Bite Squad.","Zelda H.","The food is wonderful. Fresh pasta, good sauces, and good wine.
Service is not as good as it used to be. Pizza is soggy. Giving it 4 stars because in general, the food is top-notch.","Ryan T.","I'm so glad I found this place. It's small, but the ambiance and homemade food make for one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to. Our server had excellent recommendations for food, including gluten free and pescatarian and gluten free options. In fact for gluten free options, many things on the menu including deep fried dishes and pasta, can be made without wheat to perfection.
Get a reservation or go early!","Rahul D.","Against my selfish desire to keep this place secret, I'm writing a public review of this place.
I have been here several times with varying party sizes and types (2, 4, 10, some vegetarians, some pescatarians, typical omnivores, etc.), for my birthday, parents' birthday, going-away parties, date nights, etc.
I have had the family-style serving every time (35 for antipasti, pasta, meat, and dessert!!). The staff is excellent at accommodating dietary restrictions that vary throughout the party, and their choices always satisfy.
The quality is always excellent, the service is always great, the drinks are always smooth and well-priced, and the value is always incredible.
I hope you all get to enjoy this small restaurant, be sure to reserve ahead of time due to limited seating.","AJ A.","Had the mortadella and fried egg sandwich for lunch. DELICIOUS!
Quaint, lots of personality. Hidden away in the back of a tiny collection of ground floor shops. It's actually around the corner and in back.","Kevin L.","This is my hands-down favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. I live in Capitol Hill and the Italian places are nice, but they're a bit upscale and hit or miss as they try out the hottest and hippest ingredients on the market.
Aglio e Olio, however, I found randomly when I decided I needed a bite to eat and was in the area. It's a small intimate restaurant and I was thinking: ""Sigh, whatever. At least I can just get pasta or something.""
Wow. This place has hands down my favorite meatballs I've ever had in my entire life. They're huge, and they taste AMAZING. I've been going back more frequently now, and I also have to recommend the Calamari. It's not deep-fried, it's not crispy, but instead it's this AMAZING pan-seared quality. Please, please, please do yourself a favor and try the Calamari. Ridiculously good!
Anyways. I didn't realize I was coming into a wonderful small family-style and family-tasting Italian restaurant until I tasted the food, and at that point I realized I was in a good place.
I love you, Aglio e Olio! I hope you stay here for a very long time."
"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Chandra D.","I came here for dinner on a Saturday night with my husband while on a weekend trip in Seattle.
Great vibe and atmosphere! It was very busy and waiting in the lobby/entrance area is a little awkward. Most people didn't want to wait outside in the cold, but in the summer this would work--not so much on a chilly, misty October evening. It was crowded and I know when I'm eating, I don't want people hovering over me or bumping into me. If they can figure out the waiting issue, this would be great!
Our food and service was top-notch. We shared the arborio' risotto with goat cheese and basil, and I found it to be flavorful; each flavor profile was tasty. I enjoyed the salty goat cheese! The risotto wasn't mushy, either. It was tender and just right. I ordered the ravioli of the day, and it was also good. However, I really enjoyed my risotto.
Great food and great service!","Maria M.","I came here to celebrate my birthday and I was disappointed with both the food and service. The server seemed annoyed at any questions and also seemed to be in a hurry (it was on a Thursday so not very busy). He was not very friendly and came around twice or so doing just the bare minimum.
The grilled calamari ($16), had an excruciating charred flavor. My pasta, which was the ravioli of the day, tasted just okay nothing amazing. This was definitely my first and last time coming here.
I wouldn't recommend it.","Ibrahim A.","I had a special occasion and decided to spend this occasion at Barolo. I was looking to try an Italian place and checked the reviews and decided to give it a shot. I called to make a reservation and informed them that this is a special occasion and they acknowledged my reservation and informed me that they will accommodate me with something special. I checked in with the host, the seated me right away as they were not busy.
Service
The service at this place does not meet an upscale restaurant service. They also do not do anything special for you like a decoration at the table or free desert if you have a special occasion even though they confirm that on the phone with you when you make a reservation.
Food
Starters
Ordered 2 appetizer dishes the tuna tartare and the Cheese Burata with mushrooms. The appetizers were the only thing that did stand out for the whole evening.
Main course
Ordered the ravioli with mushroom and the rigatoni with lamb. The rigatoni with lamb was a bit salty and did not meet my expectations. However , the ravioli with mushrooms was ok.
We finally decided to skip on dessert and call it a night. I would say that I was bummed that this place did not meet my expectations.","Tejashree M.","This looked like an upscale restaurant with good ambience but the service I got was a bit disappointing. They left just a paper bill on my table without saying anything or asking for desserts. After asking, it took them forever to bring out the dessert. I was seated at a table in the bar section on a Thursday night.
The tapenade served with bread at the beginning was the only amazing item here. The gnocchi was okay and the tiramisu was decent.","Lakshmi V.","I went to this restaurant with office colleagues and we had a good time.. I liked the food....ambience.. wine was nice.. beautiful.. vegetarian options are quite limited, I enjoyed the portion size. My chicken entree was yum.. couldn't complete the whole thing though ..ha ha ha. Overall a cool place for office parties and larger crowds. Service was good.. we were 20 plus people, everything was served on time. Salad & desserts are average.","Vivian L.","Our favorite tables are the corner booths away from the bar (17, 15, etc.), or, at the far end corner of the bar itself--away from the chaos but enough to people watch and talk over date nights.
Foods
First time? Get the rabbit, it's their best stable dishes here. I never liked rabbit before because it always tasted chewy and drenched in gravy (typical French style). Here, the rabbit is juicy, tender, and with seared flavorings similar to a deep fried quail thigh. A creamy pasta dish. My favorite part was the rabbit's heart as I love organ meats and feel American meat recipes don't call for them enough.
If you're lucky to catch them on their lamb shank special of the day, get it. $35 and large enough to share, though I did see the fellow next to us finished up his.
Dessert
If you love cannoli like my husband, then you should get the cannoli. He seems to really like it.
The bread pudding is good, warm, prepared well, and on the lighter side. It's not your typical American bread pudding drizzled in caramel topped with ice cream.
Service
Outstanding. From hostess to waiters to bartenders to floor manager. It feels like family coming here. Not your pizzeria family, but your upscale cousin's family, haha. Whatever the case, this place will cheer you up on a bad day or the very least, not ruin your good days.
Price
Very reasonably priced. You get your money's worth here. The free focaccia bread alone is worth a visit. They always give us extra to bring home :), it's yummy. And I here their happy hour is one of the best in town. Will have to check that out!
Atmosphere
Classy. Family. Fun. Romantic. Italian.
No kids. Great!
No pets, either.
Location
Street view is The Westin's parking garage and Mc Donald's. It's almost like you've found a hidden gem.","Judi W.","Came here with a good friend because we deserve a good meal after a long week of school AND it was a good excuse to try a new place due to Seattle Restaurant week.
ENVIRONMENT - Very very dim. I could barely make out the people's faces at far tables. It's a cozy setting and the place is quite narrow. But it was comfortable and snug in our booth.
FOOD -
Poached pear, mozzarella, with prosciutto - Simple appetizer which I thought was a good way to start a meal. I loved the combination of sweet (from the pear), creamy (from the cheese), and salty (from the prosciutto) flavor that were on the dish.
Italian sausage lentil soup - My friend got this one and I had a bit of it. It's quite sizable for an appetizer and there were good chunks of sausages in it. Good hardy flavor and it filled her up.
Squid ink risotto with baked salmon - I loved the risotto. It's a bit briny and salty from the squid ink but it was also creamy. One of my favorite parts of the meal was this. The salmon was also nice and tender. I overestimate my appetite sometimes so I thought this plate wouldn't fill me up, but it really did!
Chocolate torte - My friend got this one, and the presentation was nice! Simple and decorated with strawberries. The torte is a good amount and was rich in chocolate.
Cannoli - I thought it would be smaller, but it was pretty big! I was also stuffed at this point, so I was thankful the dessert wasn't too large. It was my first time having a cannoli so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but it's very heavy on the cream and the pastry bit was crunchy and hard. I still enjoyed it though!
SERVICE - Made a reservation for 7:15PM and we did arrive on time, but had to wait around 20min before being seated which is fine but ideally, would have liked to be seated sooner since we did arrive before our reservation time. But then again, it was SRW so I know they were packed! Service was good though! Very attentive and would always check in to see how we were doing and gave us good descriptions of the food when we ordered them. A lot of the words, we didn't know (due to our lack of knowledge on foodology terms or lack of Italian) so it was super helpful that the waiter told us what the dish consisted of.
Overall, I would come back to try their regular menu. It is kind of tucked away and the environment and space is a bit too narrow for my comfort, but the food was decent and the service was really good!","Nan F.","Updated review on 11/4:
They took one hour to sit us down (we were 4) even though we had reservations.
Then another hour to bring the food. I'm not kidding.
The quality of the food has diminished. And don't expect that the food will be consistent. I came back to eat something I like and in three occasions it was different. How is it possible? One day they add capers the other they remove them and make the sauce creamier (not good) and then the portions are a lot smaller but same price. I mean: come on.
I doubt I will be back. Making pasta is easy. How can someone ruin that?","Tara L.","My family was coming into town to celebrate birthdays and wanted Italian food. I came across this place and was able to place a reservation for 14 people within 2 week's notice. I like how they included the addition of ""happy birthday"" along with my aunt's name on the menu.
When we arrived, we were seated very promptly. The waiter we had was very friendly and the service overall was great. I enjoyed the bread with an olive tapenade was very good and was offered before dinner. For an appetizer, we just ordered green beans which was cooked and very flavorful with lemon.
For entrees, I ordered the carbonara. I liked that the dish had pork belly instead of bacon or pancetta like most carbonara dishes. The pork belly was cooked well and added a nice crisp. My boyfriend ordered the ravioli special of the day, which was potato and mushroom ravioli. I personally think his dish was better and would definitely recommend their ravioli.
Overall, I would come back here especially for their happy hour deals. Their pastas are handmade, which is always a nice addition. This place is also a cute date night place or great for parties.","Zermin A.","Finally made it into this hidden gem in Seattle! Let's just say they have a hell of a happy hour menu! For the quality of food you get, the price point is a steal! We ordered the HH Rose and it was delicious! The grilled caesar salad I had here has to be one of the best I have ever had! The tune carpaccio was delightful and the service was outstanding! We loved the bartender, super friendly and attentive!
I will be back to try out the other items on their menu! Definitely recommend this place!","Jessica M.","Best place for carbonara! I LOVE pasta and this Italian restaurant in Seattle has a really creamy and flavorful taste in their carbonara which I love. Right after you get your entree you may think that the portion is too small but it's mainly because they use a large plate. It ended up getting me super full I couldn't finish it all. I also got a cocktail, which is probably why I got full too quickly. Some of my other friends ordered different pasta dishes and some said they didn't like it. I guess it just depends on what you get.
I came here for a friend's birthday dinner and the server we had took care of us pretty well. His enthusiasm was great and he was very knowledgeable of the menu. They even customized our menus and labeled ""Happy Birthday"" and put the birthday girl's name on it! Definitely makes you feel special lol.","Latifa S.","Darn!!!
This place really went down hill. Such a shame. Everything went down. Had 2 extremely warm bottles of wine: even asked for ice. They kept it chill but it was the warmest wine. Seattle's been hot lately. And both bottles of wine tasted like they have been outside.
It wasn't as busy as it used to be in the past either. But our plates weren't cleaned off the table for a long while too. Should've set at the bar with Heidi! But we had a table. The tuna tartare was covered in onions. Way way more onions than there should be. Pasta was a ok too.
The worst was the wine. Warm bottles of wine!! Such a shame. I love this place. Haven't been back in a bit. But to see it go down in both food/wine and service is a bummer!!","Thea W.","Where do I begin? My husband and I have been here twice, first for our engagement dinner and again for my birthday just a few days ago. The first time we hit up Happy Hour- super good deals on the bar menu and drink specials. The service was good and the food was absolutely delicious. We ordered more than half the menu and were not disappointed by any of it- standouts were the ahi and the quality of the pasta. The server caught me staring at my hand and asked if I'd just gotten my nails done. Slightly embarrassed I told her We had just gotten engaged and I couldn't stop looking at the beautiful and unique ring my (now) husband had put on my finger. She brought out a chocolate desert at the end of the meal, complete with a fantastic sparkler candle to help us celebrate. It was very special and memorable.
Our trip two days ago was for the full dinner service. We were a group of 6 and they gave us a beautiful semi-private room where we managed to order about half the menu- starting out with many entrees as share plates before settling on individual entrees. Everything was absolutely exquisite. I wanted a different setting for my cut of meat which she happily accommodated. Standouts were the pheasant gnocchi, the rack of lamb, and the filet. All the meat was cooked just perfectly. I'm not normally a pasta eater but the freshness and quality of this pasta is undeniably delicious.
The server was lovely, helpful and very knowledgeable about the wines (impressive, even to the mother of all wine snobs at our table). She was very attentive without being overly-present.
On top of ordering half the menu, we ordered 4 bottles of wonderful wine and every desert. I can't say enough good things about Barolo. It was the best birthday dinner I have ever had and we will definitely be back.o","Richard M.","We went to Barolo, with a large party of 12 or 13, to celebrate a birthday and we had a wonderful time. It does a very good job at catering to special occasions.
When reserving the large party, the staff asked what the occasion was and we told them it was for a birthday. We provided them with the name of the person and when we arrived they gave the birthday girl a ""commemorative"" menu with her name and the occasion the top.
The server was very friendly and patient. Our group came slightly late and we didn't feel rushed to order/get things going while we waited for late guests. He came to our name several times throughout the service to make sure we had everything that we needed. It was nice.
The ambiance is perfect for a date night or special occasion, with the dim lighting and slightly upscale decor. It's a place where you could definitely come in wearing jeans and a t-shirt and be accepted, but also come in wearing dress attire and not be over dressed either.
The service, like most Italian restaurants, started with bread and some sort of olive oil-based dipping sauce. It was a little sweet, not my favorite, but it wasn't bad. The bread was good though, it had a little salt on top which made it easy to come back for more. We were a bit disappointed that we weren't offered more after finishing what was brought to the table, though I suppose that would've asked for more.
Of the many items on the menu, I tried one of the daily specials, which was a Squid Ink Pasta in a Pesto Sauce with Scallops and Salmon Roe and the Spaghetti Carbonara.
It was the first time that I had tried Squid Ink Pasta and I really enjoyed it. The pasta was al dente and had a nice salty, umami, flavor that you don't get with regular pasta. The pesto was light and refreshing and paired well with the pasta. There were two large scallops, I could've went for another, because they were perfectly cooked. I did expect a bit more Salmon Roe - and expected it to be atop the pasta, but it was scattered around the plate. Each bit with the Roe has a wonderful salty flavor. It was an extremely umami experience, between the saltiness of the Roe, Parmesan in the Pesto and the pasta itself. I would definitely order this again.
The Carbonara was a classic Carbonara. It was rich, salty, creamy and smoky. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the saltiness and smokiness of the pork paired really well with the creaminess from the eggs. Very good Carbonara.
After the meal they came with a small cake and a sparkler for a candle. It was pretty cool and a nice way to celebrate.
Also, it has a pretty robust wine list as well. Plenty of by glass, half bottle or full bottle options.
All-in-all its a very good restaurant, perfect for a date night or special occasion.
The only real negative is that it's a little expensive, but you could argue that's the trade off for the ambiance and execution for a large party. That being said, Seattle is filled with so many terrific Italian restaurant that serve just as food, if not better pasta, for the same price or less. But, if you don't mind spending a little money, check it out.","Jennifer L.","I was here tonight for my birthday and I was very underwhelmed, my friends who came with me love Italian food and had no interest in this place at the end of the night. I will add that our server named Francisco was extremely rude and aggressive, he was pushing us to order quickly and was rude when we had any questions. Not only that but also he rushed us and he himself was rushed although it was not that busy. For such a large group as ours there should be more assistance and attentiveness given.
I will start with the PROS.
- This place is good for group and large parties especially when you're celebrating a birthday. They bring out a small dessert with a sparking candle on it and it's very special. (Picture below shows our own cake brought)
- the carbonara was very good!! And well made, it was buttery and had the right amount of salt ($23)
- one star was added for the ambiance and the romantic lighting
CONS:
- as stated earlier the waiter was extremely rude and distant, he brushed us off so much that everyone had to comment about it at the table (we do not normally speak of people like that)
- all the other dishes we had including the meat, lamb rag and the bread and appetizers were NOT GOOD.. there are definitely a lot better Italian places to fill the need for some good pasta and bread... this is not it.
This experience was low and I will not be eating here again, I think also the waiter ruined the night for us with his attitude. If you're going to eat here I think it's best to go for HH when the options are good for its prices. Also, you can expect quick service and for the waiter to brush you off more than you would for a sit down dinner with added gratuity.","Corey S.","My husband and I visited Barolo for dinner with our friends on a Thursday night during restaurant week. It's a perfect spot if you're celebrating a special occasion; the low lighting makes it very romantic, and the food is high quality and prepared beautifully.
For our first course, three of use ordered the English Green Peas Puree' and Guanciale, which was rich, creamy, and probably my favorite item the whole night. I'm pescatarian, so I was delighted when they told me they could make any of the 1st courses vegetarian (they kindly removed the Guanciale). The 4th member of our party ordered the Speck And Mozzarella, Poached Pear (without the speck), and loved it as well.
For our main courses, my husband and I both ordered the Cernia alla Livornese with heirloom tomatoes and squid ink risotto, which was divine. We especially loved the squid ink risotto; I was worried might taste fishy, but it was the perfect texture and savory flavor. One of our friends ordered the Wild Boar Tenderloin Honey with juniper chanterelles, and he absolutely loved his dish! My husband had passed on ordering the boar because he was worried it would be too gamey, but it was cooked to perfection (seared on the outside and rare on the inside), and ended us wishing he'd ordered the same dish. Our 4th friend ordered the Raviolone with kale ricotta and local pumpkin puree and also finished off her dish!
For dessert, I was the only one to request the Torta Salame di Cioccolato, and it was amazing! The other three ordered the Cannoli, which I tried and enjoyed as well.
Our waiter was fun and friendly and joked around with whom I think must've been the manager, as he visited our table at some point in the evening.
I only have a couple small critiques; the first being that was a little loud and I had some trouble hearing my friends who were sitting right next to me. It also took a little longer for our food to come out than I was expecting. Both of these can be chalked up to it being restaurant week and they were serving a higher volume of people than normal (which is a good thing!).
Overall, I highly recommend Barolo for a high quality, fine dining experience!","Kalpana R.","The food here was overall 3.5 stars but the service left something to be desired for and hence rounding down to 3 stars.
I came here with a large group of colleagues and each of us ordered an entree and then we shared desserts. Some of us also got some beverages.They served us with bread and dip while we were waiting for the orders but that was never re-filled. Maybe that's the restaurant policy but the empty bread plates sat on the table for a long time which was weird and made us expect refills. One person was served a barely warm coffee which had to be sent back.
Our server told us to not look at the pictures on Yelp to decide what to order and that he would be the best person to consult if we had any questions about the dishes. This also was weird; I understand that restaurants make changes to dishes but outright telling us to not look at pictures was off-putting/patronizing. One of my colleague also asked if they could get their lunch earlier than others, which was also meet with another patronizing statement that it takes time to serve 10+ people. This might have been a misunderstanding that the server thought that they were asking for everyone's lunch to come out quickly but still the response could have been better.
Moving on to the food, my carbonara was great! It also was deceptively huge quantity; and I especially loved the pork belly. The other entrees had mixed reviews ranging from meh to not bad to decent. The tiramisu was also decent and so was the affogato, but the latter could have been better if they had added more ice cream and less of the whipped cream.
Overall, I might get food to-go next time but not dine-in because of the service.","Lexi H.","Ahh, Barolo. What a complicated relationship we have. How do you always lure me into your late night happy hour?
Barolo is - hands down - my favorite happy hour in Seattle. 50% off bar food with $20 bottles of wine (red, white, or rose) is an absolute steal. They also have an excellent wine list outside of the happy hour, but the $20 bottles are always nicely selected and good for table wine. Happy hour is 3 - 6 p.m., with late night happy hour 10 p.m. - midnight.
The complimentary bread with an olive tapenade is reason enough to come here. I don't know how they are sent tapenade from heaven, but they figured out a way to import it, apparently. Man, it's good.
BUT, here's the real reason I get drawn into Barolo: THE BAKED ESCARGOT. Not sure if you like escargot? Trust me, order it, because you will. You get 6 escargots (removed from the shell) baked in a little muffin tin-like ceramic dish, swimming in a delectable butter sauce. Perfect use for extra bread - eat that lil' snail and then soak the bread in one of those little slots full of butter-ous harmony.
Other favorites: the grilled calamari is perfectly cooked and seasoned. The cheese plate is a crowd pleaser, especially if you have a not-so-adventurous friend with you. All of the pastas I have tried will hit that carb-sized hole in your heart (and stomach).
The location is intimate (read: the bar area is small) with a dark, but upscale, atmosphere. I have always enjoyed our servers and bartenders; very friendly and chatty. Note that it is next to the main Amazon HQ campus, so the early happy hour is PACKED Monday-Friday, so arrive early if you are looking to go then. In the summer, the small outdoor area is buzzing with Amazonians in search of the city's best happy hour, so it can be difficult to get a seat.
5 stars for happy hour, with a solid 4 for the rest of the time (the full menu is tasty in itself, albeit a bit rich). Even when I promise myself I am going to try another happy hour, I end up here - and always leave so happy, full, and ready to come back.","Melanie N.","Today I enjoyed a delicious meal at Barolo. We went on a tip that their bar menu was half off all day on Sunday. The bar menu was full of diverse, large meals! You could enjoy a cheese plate, salad, burger, homemade pasta dishes or beef tenderloin. I enjoyed the rigatoni with beef and veal ragu! It was a hearty, delicious meal! I loved it! The only down side to the meal was the service. It was slow and rather inattentive. Even that, wouldn't keep me from going back and enjoying another great meal at Barolo! I'd suggest trying this wonderful Italian restaurant, especially on a Sunday!","Alexis M.","This was the best pasta dish I have had in years. I got the penne with smoked salmon in a cream sauce with no asparagus. We also had the grilled octopus which was delicious as well. A little pricy for pasta (25$ for mine) but it was totally worth it!"
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Katrina M.","Dinner with my husband tonight and we came here for the first time. Carrello made for a wonderful evening with a great setting and a great feel!
What is unique about their restaurant is the small plates they serve via rolling carts. We had heard about these and being a fan of trying many dishes, we came not knowing if you could make a dinner of these small offerings or not.
They offered about 10 small dishes throughout the time we were here and we had about 7 of them. They were all wonderful but they were small (some only $3-4 each but ranged to $11) and not enough to make a dinner. So we ordered a salad, a pasta and a fish (whole branzino) from the main menu as well. This was the perfect amount of food as the main menu dishes were small also. Total bill before tip was about $135.
Food was fantastic, loved it all. Pasta had a wonderful texture, but it was a small dish size as well. We had so many things that it is difficult to name them all. Fun place to go, especially if you like to try many things instead of one single entree.","Gav J.","I have to align with Kevin Z who nailed it in his review below. Unnecessarily pretentious waitstaff ruined what could've been a really great experience. the space is lovely and in a beautiful part of Capitol Hill.
The initial service is fantastic and the bread is to die for, however the pasta was overcooked, salad overdressed and the wait staff less than friendly.
Dessert yielded the worst semi Freddo ever. The cart concept is fantastic but fails to deliver on the food and ultimately provided an overall mediocre experience at a high cost.
I will not be returning here again.","Nate H.","I'll be honest with you I wasn't that impressed just looking at the pictures of this place. It looked like a place where I would get a really small pasta dish and destroy my credit score doing so. Boy was I wrong... this place is fantastic.
Luckily for Carrello, my girlfriend convinced me to go to this place with her for our anniversary because she really liked the decorations (hanging plants bring the ladies in apparently). We were very impressed by the ambiance and the friendly service. You definitely get the chic hipster vibe when you're in here, so make sure you wear your finest beanie.
This place combines incredible pasta with a mini surprise dish at every turn. They give you a wooden block which signifies to the wait staff if you're in the mood for some Italian delicacies. As you're waiting for your dishes, they bring around all sorts of goodies from calamari, to fancy meatballs, or a massive tray of desserts.
The pasta itself made me want to kiss an Italian grandmother. We took the risk of getting a dish with tripe in it for the first time ever, and it paid off. I can't even remember what the name of the pasta was, but the blend of tripe and veal was so rich and creamy that I forgot I was eating a baby animals and stomach lining.","Elizabeth L.","Tasty pasta, limited menu selection, $$$-$$$$. With its Altura lineage, the pasta at Carrello is delicious - absolutely recommend the agnolotti, pappardelle with oxtail, tripe, anchovy crumb, and gnocchi, all which were divine. We also enjoyed the spicy pan roasted brassicas (broccolini, cauliflower), despite the steep price at $17 for a veggie side.
Aside from the limited menu, Carrello features an Italian take on dimsum with small plates being offered on carts. The roasted beets were tasty but otherwise average, the lamb meatball similarly so. While we enjoyed the prosciutto, the portion was rather miniscule. Would pass on the cured veal. According to our server, roughly 14 snacks and small plates are offered on carts each night.
In full disclosure, we avoided the From the Table meat entrees, which were steeply priced - $59 for roasted whole fish, $125 for dry aged ribeye (would expect 4-star steakhouse at that price), $47 for whole roasted chicken, $59 for roasted lamb neck (wow!).
Portions are small, as reviews note, so prepare to spend $60-$70 pp. Highly recommend cocktails and pasta if you're curious about the Carrello experience!","Mia Z.","Interesting that it's Italian/American in dim sum style, they push out carts around the place every 10 min, small plates so you get to taste a lot of appetizers. We had beef tartar(amazing), rabbit and pork meat balls(absolutely fantastic), beet salad(good).
Each cart has a number on there which represents the price of the item. Then they mark on the small sheet of paper on your table of what you get (like how dim sum works).
I highly recommend coming for the cart. The entree pastas are mediocre to me. We will be back for only cart.","Sheryl K.","Recently tried this place and I can't wait to go back and try more things!
The concept of the restaurant is really similar to dim sum where people come around with carts of food and mark off what you select on a note card. However, this experience was probably a lot better than going to a dim sum restaurant because they don't pressure you and push you to buy food! I guess you can say it's Italian cuisine with the dim sum cart concept.
I can't remember what we picked up from the carts and what we ordered through our server, but everything was very delicious. My only negative comment is that some dishes were pretty spicy but I'm super weak sauce with spicy food. So if you're a normal person that can handle mildly spicy to pretty hot foods, you'd love it. My entree had a slight kick, which was ok-ish for me. I would've preferred no kick/no spice at all, but that's just me. But ate all of it because it was that tasty!
So if you're looking for an Italian restaurant that has a fun ordering experience, I highly recommend coming to try this place out. I'm definitely ready to come back and try more!","Jacqueline D.","We got a reservation here on Tuesday night for a girls night. Surprising that we were able to make the reservation a few days prior, but I imagine it'll be harder as Carrello gets more and more well known.
Such a cool concept - you can order a bunch of food from a menu - large meat plates, pasta and apps.., and while waiting or eating, there are carts w/ smaller tapas size portions being pushed around that you can also order off of (imagine dim sum but make it italian). These range from $3-$12 and is super fun to supplement your main meal!
We also had some great wine - they do have a sommelier if you need additional help/recs to pair the right wine with your meal!
One of our group members was vegetarian, and although they don't have a ton of veg specific items, most menu items can be made vegetarian with fantastic substitutes, where it didn't feel like a substitution/customized dish!
Everything we tried was delicious - from the apps, to small plates to pasta... great flavors and honestly afterwards made me excited for my next visit!!!","Sara C.","I hate to review this because I know it's going to get harder and harder to snag reservations here, but they deserve it.
We heard from friends that the pasta is the way to go here, so we ordered three pastas - their gnocchi, agnolotti and chittara - and then ordered a few things from the different small plate carts.
The verdict - not only was the pasta SO good but the carts made it a really fun experience as well. Not to mention these small plates were VERY decently priced. For example, we got two plates of prosciutto and coppa for $3 EACH.
We really, really loved this place and would definitely want to come back again. I think the prices were just fine for the quality and experience.","Sara A.","I came across Carello when walking past it looking for a place to eat in the area. They have an interesting concept that I really appreciated. You order your entrees (larger and for the table to share--can take 40-60 mins) plus smaller dishes. They have carts going around throughout the evening with smaller bites you can share. They place a card on your table with number on it and and this number corresponds to the numbers on the cards with the small bites as well as the price of that particular item. Items on the carts vary daily.
We weren't too hungry so we got the beef and veal spaghetti, the brassicas (cauliflower mix), and bread and picked up fried artichoke hearts from one of the carts. I loves the spaghetti. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce was on point. Not overly spicy, but very flavorful. The brassicas were on the spicy wide, but more like too many spices were used as opposed to hotness. It was a little overwhelming. We also munched on some bread which is served with olive oil and butter as an appetizer. The artichoke hearts were also delicious.
Overall, I had a great experience here and loved the food. The plates they have for the table did seem a bit overpriced for what they were though. Pastas and smaller sides were more reasonable.","Latifa S.","Opening night meal!
I've already been a big fan of Altura for a while, naturally I'd have to check out their new venture too. This place came up rather fast for a new spot. The old place closed down, chef Nathan took over! And viola! It's a whole new spot!
The menu was simple enough. Carts of items with prices on it: like dim sum but Italian style. Rabbit meatball, grilled octopus, hamachi crudo, grilled peppers, desserts etc. You pick what you want. And contorni/ salads/bread, pasta and meat/seafood. Meat and seafood dish take about 45-60 minutes to come out so order accordingly.
We had the octopus with lentil, chicory salad, grano with crab and rock shrimp, tagliatelle with anchovy oil and tonno (tuna heart). And the rosemary lemonade and red wine!
The octopus was amazing and delicious. Tiny bite sizes, spicy pepper. Just great. Pasta portions are much smaller than small portions. The tagliatelle was delicious: even had some kale in it? The grano sauce was good but pasta itself was undercooked. We like al dente in our Italian family but this was much undercooked. Would've been great to try a better cooked version.
The chicory was a ok as well. Overall, I was just excited to be here and trying the new concept from my old favorite spot. Cart concept was good but once you missed a cart, it took forever to come back. Some don't even come back. We missed the octopus first time around and got it almost an hour later. Since it's a cart item, you can't order it. Same with mussels. And dessert!
Our server was super friendly. Took about 35-40 minutes to get our bill and pay though. They got busy at the end, it got slow. Same with the carts: once you miss one, it takes forever to get it back since they remake it. . I'm a small eater and left hungry. Overall, 3.5 stars for opening night. But since I can't do .5, I'm rounding it up.","Kelley J.","Very solid spot, was pleasantly impressed. Despite many comments, can be very reasonably priced based discretionary orders- don't go loco w/ the carts.","Mimi T.","After dining at Altura recently, I was more than happy to find out about Carrello. We decided to come here for an anniversary celebration and the experience didn't disappoint! I've been to one other restaurant (that's not dim sum) that also specializes in traveling carts of food, but the first Italian one.
As for the food, you start with ordering the non-cart items (but if you're like us, we decided to pick a few small items from the carts as it came by first).
+PUMPKIN: We decided to order a contorni (vegetable side dish) and we were so happy to go with this one. The incredibly soft and almost creamy pumpkin (kind of reminded me of sweet potatoes) came topped with hazelnut butter and crispy guanciale! It was the perfect sweet and salty dish! Just to note, my boyfriend doesn't like pumpkin but this might've been one of our favorite dishes here!
-PARSNIP GNOCCHI: I think I just wasn't expecting this one. It's not quite a fluffy gnocchi (maybe because it's made of parsnip?) and came with bits of boar.
-GRANO ARSO RAVIOLI: This was the crab ravioli (came with 3). For this one, I also wasn't used to the pasta dough - it didn't really have the chewiness I normally like in pasta. It was almost stiff. But the broth it came with was deliciously light!
Of these menu items, I think I'd be hesitant to order more of the pasta - they weren't necessarily bad, just not my favorite pasta texture.
As for the cart items, I have to say that I'm the type of person that loves tapas and small dishes, so we definitely focused more on these. The cart items range from $3 upward and each cart has 2-3 items. For dessert, you tell them that you're done with the meal and someone will come out with a cart of all the dessert options!
+DUCK MOUSSE: This was definitely my favorite but I'm a sucker for liver mousses. Oh, and also the crackers were fried in duck fat - no biggie! The dish also came with cranberries on top (loved the tartness to cut the fat).
+BEEF CRUDO: Just so good. The cracker actually reminded us of the exact same crackers from Altura!
+FRIED DOUGH: Okay, can you really go wrong with fried dough? It was only $3, greatly seasoned and went amazingly with the salami.
+SALAMI: Delicious! A pretty good portion that you can also see them slicing in the middle of the restaurant!
+CELERY SALAD WITH ANCHOVY: This looks and sounds so simple but it was delicious! Don't skip out on it!
+LIMONCELLO SEMIFREDDO: Didn't really taste like limoncello to me but it was scrumptious nonetheless! The berries on the bottom were great too!
All in all, I think you get the Altura flavors without the high price tag (though I wouldn't say this is a cheap meal - though worth it!). The service is great and the staff are incredibly friendly! All in all, would definitely return!","Grace C.","This is the pasta place that tried too hard and failed. Tl;dr- get the bread. The pasta is just normal pasta dishes with fancy additions that miss the mark completely.
To start we ordered the bread, potatoes and carrots to share. Two items off the dim sum carts. We each ordered our own pasta- I ordered the tagliatelle for myself.
The homemade bread for $8 is no joke. This is the best bread ever. It's soft and squishy in the middle and the crust has this crunch that is so delicious- it might be the only time I enjoyed the crust more than the inside. The bread alone is 5/5 stars and I am coming back for the bread.
The potatoes were nice- better than the carrots. The potatoes seemed to be double fried and has their own mayo and a sea of sage but so good. The carrots were ok- there's a little bit of bacon in the ocean that is peanuts and it has a tinge of sweetness that was kind of weird.
Off the dim sum cart we got a fried dough and some of the charcuterie- each $4 and not worth it. The fried dough was weird and bland. And to have the charcuterie wrapped around it (as suggested) did not enhance anything for me except the lament that I was down $8.
And the tagliatelle. What's disappointment. It looks nice in the pics- trust me- but it's topped with a giant mount of tuna in hopes to differentiate it from the normal spaghetti aglio e olio. The waiter recommended I mix in the tuna to make it less fishy but then I basically was eating an overly oily aglio e olio. Binging with babish would be disappointed with the amount of olive oil left over.
In short. Not coming back except for the wine and bread. The third star is for the bread.","Kevin Z.","Dining at a higher price point (which typically means small portions) can be a fantastic experience when done right. Carrello simply had too many misses for me to be a worthwhile experience for how much it cost.
We started with some bread and fried potatoes. This was the best course of the meal. The bread had a lovely char and was accompanied by some warm butter. Biting into the buttered bread was like crispy heaven. The potatoes were also crispy and well cooked, though the cooks went a little too crazy on the fried sage.
We then got a bunch of pasta to share, many of which had crispy fish flakes on top. While I understand that adding fish flakes or fish sauce can add a lot of umami to a dish, there was simply too much on our pasta which made it taste really fishy and unappetizing. I personally ordered the tagliatelle with tripe. Pasta was cooked well but I felt that the texture of the tripe really ruined the dish. The weird dim sum carts kept coming around the whole time. We ordered some small dishes but weren't really that impressed.
Overall I think I won't be returning for a second meal. The food was only OK and the atmosphere felt unnecessarily pretentious.","Phil G.","Carrello, I am constantly forgetting the name, was too much fun. The food was good too! We sat at the liquor bar to eat and immediately struck up conversations with the patrons and the engaging bartender named Firenze. My wife, the true foodie, ordered the food while I gabbed and posed. The pastas were fantastic as was everything else I ate. We ordered too much, as is our wont, and everything tasted wonderful. Everyone at Carrello was smiling, and this is a happy place to be.
The mother restaurant to Carrello is just across the street named Altura. It is a gastronomic destination with an expensive degustation menu. Carrello is the perfect counterpart, with its casual, boisterous vibe. Prices were reasonable but the experience made money irrelevant. A great time is priceless.","Tracie D.","Sits On the end of busy broadway street. My first time here and id have to say I'm very impressed. Staff is very nice especially the bartender!
Im fairly picky on my rating for YELP and overall food experience. But this place has been exceptional!
We had the spaghetti , ravioli, duck pasta , another dish was baked vegetables (sorry forgot the name which was amazing btw) and the fish entree. ALL WELL CRAFTED.
What caught me by surprise was the ""cart"" serving small tasters of their foods which doesn't happen much in seattle restaurants which is a nice surprise
The food options aren't huge but does make up in taste. Would have to say price is on the high end for portion size. If you were to come alone and wanted a ""meat"" dish it would be impossible to finish.
Id like to see smaller options for less. Which would be nice for bar areas seating when you're there for a quick bite. Cause pasta size is on point for single servings.","Liz J.","Service was definitely off. We got there 15 mins early and they made us wait until exactly 7:30 before we were seated, and they had a number of empty tables. They had a number of carts going around with apps/small plates, but half of the carts just went by our table and they didn't even tell us about what was on it. And we were looking at the servers directly since we were hungry.
When we finally did get our first item, no one had stopped by our table to even take a drink order. Which was a shame because I would have liked a glass of wine with the cured meats we got.
Food was delicious, we ordered 2 vegetable dishes and 3 pastas and enjoyed them all immensely. Unfortunately they were all brought them to us all at the same time. All 5 plates for a small table of 2. So we barely had enough room to fit it all in. And then we had to eat really quickly before the food got cold. We each got a glass of red which went wonderfully with each dish we got. Also the fork they give you has kind of wierd dimensions? Made it really difficult to use at times to cut items, as knives were not given.
Hoping these things improve, the food was delicious. When we did interact with the wait staff they we're very friendly.","Vijay B.","Nathan Lockwood is, without a doubt, Seattle's best chef and his first restaurant - Altura - is Seattle's best restaurant. Here's my review for Altura:
yelp.com/biz/altura-seat…
If you don't know the history, Altura used to be mostly a la carte. Eventually Lockwood switched to a prixe fixe menu to showcase his culinary talents (which, if Michelin ever came to Seattle, would be amply rewarded) but that had a downside. Many of the favorite a la carte menu items were jettisoned much to the chagrin of his regular patrons. When this was brought up with Lockwood, he mentioned that he had a project in mind to create a second restaurant that would reprise these great dishes (especially the exquisite pasta dishes).
It was several years in the making and having found a perfect location, just across the street from Altura in the old Poppy space, Lockwood has opened Carrello to much fanfare. In a way Carrello feels like the old Altura in a larger space, with some extra quirks. The menu features the amazing pasta dishes that old patrons of Altura had grown to know and love but he has also added a sort of Italian dim-sum quality to the service.
Servers will periodically bring around carts with various delictations concocted by Lockwood, such as duck liver mousse from which diners can choose, if they wish, a taste. In this way Carrello allows diners to have both the a la carte experience with something of a tasting menu feel.
It goes without saying, the food is exceptional. One would expect nothing less from Lockwood, and the space is quite nice. It doesn't quite have the homey feel that Altura does and is a little spartan (I hope in time they can spruce it up a bit), but it's certainly a nice place for a lovely dinner with that special someone.
If you love high end northern italian cuisine, you must try Carrello.","Carolyn P.","We tried Carrello for a date night and could not have been happier. There is something truly delightful about the little carts that come around. We opted to pick and choose from the carts and order two pasta dishes to share. It was more than enough food, and I can see how you could make an entire meal from the cart snacks alone...and I just might do that in the near future. It was an incredible variety of items and I was impressed that each one seemed more delicious than the last. Definitely book a reservation if you don't want to wait or be disappointed.","Neiha A.","Excellent food!! One of my new favorite Italian restaurants in town. We were sitting right at the bar ( really friendly bartender.) We had vegetarian dishes Scarpinocc pasta and Farinata baked chickpea, OMG!! The flavors were outstanding.
For dessert I got the chocolate olive oil cake with caramel and hazelnut brittle, that was outstanding!!! My husband got the Cannoli which was ok.
Altura( across the street) is also owned by Nathan Lockwood. I haven't tried that, and it's on my list.
Overall great experience at Carrello, awesome food and ambience. I will go back for sure."
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kristin B.","It is a small hole in the wall restaurant that is easy to miss, but is sooo worth it. The food is among the best Italian food in the city. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something new or off the radar.
I had the chicken parmigiana and a caesar salad. Both were delicious. The chicken parm was perfectly cooked and moist. The sauce was amazing and tasty. The serving sizes were ample and more than enough for a single person.
I highly recommend this restaurant.
Accessibility: This is a very small restaurant and it is not too accessible. The washrooms are up a step or two and squeezed in a corner. The tables are all squeezed together. There is no room to sit and wait for a table. The good news is it is all tables and chairs. If you are able to work with a tight squeeze and a place that can get noisy because of the smallness of the space, then you're good to go.","Kira T.","Delightful. Cozy and intimate, with excellent service. The location is quite special - right across from tiny Weather Watch Park in West Seattle, with its breathtaking, glorious views.
The lamb shank special was ""to die for"" according to my friend who ordered it (I don't eat meat). My penne puttanesca was spicy and bracing and packed with flavor. We shared bruschetta and a caprese salad that featured superbly fresh, amazing mozzarella (although the tomatoes were a bit pallid... I blame the time of year). A couple of our party ordered pizzas. One pronounced his ""just fine"" and the other (my husband) thought his was flavorful, but ""too bready."" He's from NYC, so he likes a verrrry thin crust.
Dessert was amazing: the four of us shared a regular and a limoncello tiramisu. Both were HUGE. Both were tender and fluffy and delightful, and neither were cloyingly sweet. The flavor of the liqueur and cream shone through.
WARNING: do not trust the prices posted online! Most items on the menu were between one dollar and four dollars MORE than the online price. We still got out of there for $250 bucks for 4 of us - including 1 1/2 carafes of their decent house Montepulciano and tip - but we were expecting it to be a tad less.
That said, I would return.","Jessica R.","Best pasta spot in West Seattle, hands down! This spot is a tiny little spot on the west/south part of Alki, and definitely worth making the trip.
We have come here several times now, and most recently for my birthday. We had a group of 12 and they were very accommodating to have such a large group in such a small space. This time I got the rigatoni con ricotta, and that is probably one of my favorite dishes here. It's a rigatoni noodle with white sauce, cheese, onions, and pancetta.
They also brought me a birthday tiramisu! Overall love this place and will definitely be coming back!","Lexi H.","West Seattle institution with family-owned environment and hearty Italian classics.
The restaurant is located in a neighborhood with plenty of street parking right in Alki. La Rustica is quaint with some old-world Italian decor and white tablecloths - really what you envision when you think ""family-owned Italian restaurant"" so I was into it.
We arrived with a large party for a birthday (reservations made). For a Wednesday evening, it was very busy so I would recommend making reservations. The space is not big (inside or out on the patio), so I don't think they host large parties often. They sat us quickly, and started taking drink orders. They almost immediately brought us water and bread.
After taking our food order, service seemed to slow a bit. We had a late attendee, and they were not acknowledged until we finally caught our server's attention after 15 minutes. It was difficult as the service was great up until this point, and we seemed to have lost our server between ordering food and receiving food.
When the food arrived (which did take a while, but it was a big party and I won't dock points for that), I had to leave for an appointment so I got my pasta to go. I had ordered their squid ink pasta special. It was alright, but I'll likely get something else next time (everything else looked amazing). It was described to have a marinara/alfredo creamy sauce and the sauce didn't seem creamy to me, so I think I may have had different expectations - it was a very large portion, the pasta itself was good, and it had lots of seafood in it. The pastas are also served with a dinner salad - the homemade dressing on those were AWESOME - very garlicky and generously topped.
They serve wine by the carafe for a good price, and the food menu is large enough to give plenty of variety. I will definitely be coming back, this time with a much smaller party, to try out some of the other pastas that looked decadent and have a more intimate experience. I imagine that my star rating will go up after going with a smaller group.
Note: they can't split the check but can take up to 3 payments on a check, so keep it in mind if you're with a big group.","Jan C.","Although there are some positives about our experience here, we will not return.
Pros: Our server, Nadia, was very personable and helpful.
The antipasto mista plate was huge. Good vairety of meats, but only one kind of cheese.
Setting is very nice
Cons: The noise level is not conducive to a pleasant experience. I used my phone to check the decibel level and it was pretty steady at 80 db with times up to 87 db. Not fun!
While the wait staff was pleasant there were apparently not enough of them as there was a lot of waiting for water, etc.
The food was underwhelming. In particular, the carbonara was dry to the point of having very little flavor. I am a carbonara fan and I don't want it to be soaking in sauce, but there was almost no sauce at all on this dish.
Parking is difficult to find during the dinner hour.","Aleksandr F.","Not sure about how is food here. We did not have a chance to try it. Came to this restaurant in 15 minutes after opening but owner told us that no free tables for us and we need to wait 20-30 minutes for it. We've waited about 1 hour but couldn't wait more and came out hungry. So book table before you going to come here.","M T.","My husband and I came here for a date night and it did not disappoint! We waited about 30 minutes for a table and it was worth the wait!
I had the lasagna and it was delicious and so hearty, everything pasta should be! My husband had the chicken parmigiana and loved it. We wrapped up the night with the tiramisu, which was just delightful! The meal overall was delicious and the service was great. Food was the closest we've had to pasta we had on our honeymoon in Italy.
Come here and enjoy!!! The wait is worth the amazing food you get and the ambiance.","Sheila G.","I wanted to love this place, and I did, until later that night when I got sick from the food!
The restaurant is so beautiful if you sit on the patio. The food is really good. But I wouldn't eat there after what I experienced after, they definitely served me some bad food.
Plenty of people have been there without getting sick, but plenty of people have gotten sick too. Go at your own risk!","Aaron F.","We had our first meal at La Rustica. A cozy, welcoming atmosphere, similar vibe to a rustic country home in Tuscany. The service was excellent, courses served timely, and just the right amount of attention. The lamb gnocchi, while tender and well presented, was too heavily salted. My partner had the shrimp scampi, which we both agreed was also too salty and grilled shrimp slightly overdone. The last critique would be the cannolis we both had for dessert, which would have been a joy to my Italian grandmother had the chef decided to leave off the discordant note of raspberry drizzle. That said, the wine, coffee, appetizers, salads and service were superb. We'll try it again at some point and see how it goes.","SI G.","This place has really gone down hill. Canned mushrooms, terrible marinara pasta, canned whipped cream and ridiculous prices. They asked if we wanted to upgrade the salads to Caesar and then charged full prices for the salads that were supposed to be included in with the specials. Then they charge another $5 for anchovies. Will never go back. I gave it two stars instead of one because the waitress was attentive and friendly.","Michelle L.","Really cute place tucked away on Alki Beach. I don't know why there's so many bad reviews on service our server was super pleasant. Loved their garlic bread and salad - but next time I would skip appetizers only because you can't NOT eat a decent amount of garlic bread which fills you up. By the time our main courses came out I was like 60% full haha! I thought their full carafe of house cab sav for $38 was quite reasonable. Loved the bolognese pasta and my husband's lasagna was great too! Would definitely come back for sureee!","Nancy W.","It's been probably three years since I've been here but love it just the same. Took a friend of mine who had never been and she was in love with the place. They take no reservations so you need to get here early or be prepared for close to an hour wait. Tonight they opened at 5, we got there at 5:15, being told already that there was a 45 minute wait. Fortunately, we got called about 20 minutes later. I ordered a cosmopolitan which was great and we ordered the calamari appetizer, I ordered the lasagna with bolognese sauce and she ordered the chicken parmesan. Because of the wait at our table for service and then for the meal, we got a complimentary salad which was very nice. My drink was excellent but then there was very little meat in the bolognese sauce of my lasagna and that's primarily what I was getting it for. Not only did the wait person take it off the bill, but gave us both complimentary desserts. I wouldn't hesitate to go back. Very small setting and very warm and cozy. Menu has excellent choices as well as the wine list and cocktail menu. This place is worth the wait!","Lex D.","Amazing food and service. Get the wild boar you will not be disappointed. Everything is fresh and made to order. Be careful loading up on the bread, it is so delicious you'll forget you have a meal coming. Unless you get there at opening you will have to wait a while. They do not take reservations. Wish they would especially for special occasions. When being seated ask not to be seated at the table near the restroom. Awkward when people are standing waiting to pee as you try to dine..and reminds you that you are near the toilet. They really need to eliminate that table. There is a little bar in back by little I mean it accommodates about 7 to 8 very tiny space. Again if you're not there at opening your wait will be over and hour. Worth a try if you dont mind waiting.","D D.","Quaint and delicious! Pleasantly off the beaten path and a great gem in West Seattle.","Elisabeth P.","We were lucky enough to snag a table at this happening place on a perfect Seattle Saturday evening. We'd actually had reservations at a different restaurant to celebrate our first year wedding anniversary, but were unable to eat due to their inflexibility with my food allergy. The husband searched restaurants near us offering gf menu items and we discovered La Rustica.
Located down near the water, it has a beautiful view from the patio. Parking was a little tricky, but we enjoyed the walk along the water to and from our car. This family owned place is about as authentic as it gets. With the owner greeting guests and standing outside beckoning passerbys into his establishment, family as servers, and family in the kitchen, you immediately start to get in the mood for a home cooked meal.
We were put on a waiting list for the busy Saturday night rush, but it moved quickly and we were seated outside on the little covered patio with hanging plants and a gorgeous view of the water. Our server stopped by and took our order. Not only was she able to point out their gf items, she also assured me they'd prep my food with allergy precautions, oooo yah bring me allll the pasta.
They have a great selection of gf items to choose from. We started with their house salad which was simplistic yet incredibly fresh and delicious. I went for the gf penne with ricotta which was basically a creamy cheesy bunch of goodness. The husband loved the manicotti he ordered and had nothing left to take home.
We stopped back again just recently and had another perfect dining experience. The husband got the gnocchi and I had the gf penne with a creamy tomato sauce and beef filet. We finished with a decadent chocolate gf cake..There was not a crumb remaining on our plates.
With delicious authentic Italian cuisine at a great price, excellent service, and an unbeatable view, we left fatted and happy and looking forward to our return.","Alina P.","Definitely my favorite restaurant! Food is amazing! Service is great! A beautiful family owned restaurant, with the most authentic Italian food!","Cole M.","Good Italian restaurant in West Seattle.
I am normally critical of ""Italian"" restaurants and sometimes a glance at the menu will give me an idea.
In the menu we saw, Lamb is translated into ""Pecora"" which means Sheep. Lamb is ""Agnello"". One wonders why in this modern age, people do not use a proof reader or a decent translator. In any case...
We were seated by the corner window which offers the view of the sound and sunset. We were greeted by the kind owner, and served with fresh, warm, flavorful bread. I ordered an Italian beer and my friend a red wine.
We ordered the Calamari in umido and bruschetta as antipasto followed by Fettuccine alla Carbonara and Risotto Con Salsiccia e Funghi. I found the carbonara dry and bland, I couldn't taste the guanciale, nor the egg. My friend liked his dish. We did not have room for dessert, maybe too much bread...
Judging by the various reviews this place could be a hit or a miss. My suggestion is to go, perhaps not on busy weekends.
If you're out on a date or some romantic event, the table at the corner with windows facing the West, would be the perfect place to have dinner at.","R D.","Let me start by saying that this restaurant has a gorgeous view. It's a cozy family run place that serves delicious authentic Italian food and the service was excellent too.
Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the owner / host and showed to our table. We started off with some complimentary home made warm bread. For appetizers we got the caprese buratta plate and mushrooms with polenta. For our mains, we had the prawns risotto and Pollo buccatini pasta. Everything was fresh and delicious. The food was rich, but I am not complaining, it was delectable.
Against better judgement, we decided to order chocolate tort to share for dessert, and I am so glad we did. The chocolate wasn't too sweet and the consistency of the tort was spot on.
Overall - delicious food, friendly service, and gorgeous view. Highly recommended!","Mel S.","We had a late night dinner yesterday (Friday) night and I woke up this morning after the most glorious carb/fat-8-hour coma. The restaurant is cozy, the interior is dark and does its best old-world impression, but the food is delicious and the service is attentive.
Yesterday was a refeed day for me so I went nuts on carbs:
-bread: buttery, tasty, and addictive. If you get bread straight out of the oven and not overly baked you'll have to practice extreme restraint from eating the entire basket
-calamari to start was refreshing. It isn't your typical fried version. It's almost prepared like a soup and can be spicy depending on how heavy handed the preparer is with the spices so beware. I piled my Calamari on the bread (bc carbs are life)
-I ordered the sepia spaghetti special with seafood made with Alfredo sauce. I love Alfredo sauce but it can get sickening if you overdo it. I barely made it through half my dish (bc I was carbed out and I wore tight jeans) but I'm convinced that this dish is amazing. I was disappointed in myself for not finishing the entire thing but I did my best and my husband will now get to enjoy the leftovers today (today is not a high carb day).
-husband got the Manfredo gnocchi (which isn't traditional gnocchi FYI). He loved the lamb but wasn't impressed with the non-traditional gnocchi.
-we also ordered a half carafe of wine which paired well with our meals.
No desserts were ordered, unfortunately. My pants just wouldn't allow it.
We will definitely return. I was told they take reservations for large parties so I plan to bring my family here for my brother's graduation!","Gina F.","Great food, great service, great location, reasonable prices. Family owned. Highly recommend"
"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cassie W.","My absolute FAVORITE restaurant in Seattle. Their ravioli is to die for. The atmosphere is perfect and beautiful.
I love it. They do an amazing job.","Brooke L.","I am writing this review after many many transgressions with this neighborhood establishment. If you ask.. why did you continue to go to this restaurant if you have had numerous bad/awful experiences, there are only two reasons: one, some of the service staff were amazing; two, proximity to my house. To be honest, the food has always been mediocre at best and the restaurant is so poorly run that it's a 50/50 chance that you will have cold food, bad food, or an awkward run in with the owner and his ""managers"".
Over the last ten years, I have had my wedding rehearsal dinner there, hosted large birthday parties, assisted in a large wedding reception, and recommended friend to do the same. With the exception of my rehearsal dinner, every event has been tainted by large mistakes, hidden charges, and general dishonesty. Last Friday, I hosted my husband's 40th Birthday, mainly because of the easy access for my guests, and also I thought by ordering family style and an open bar would be hard to mess up. I was wrong. They insulted my guests on many occasions and gave us 1 member of their staff for a group of 30 people. This staff member worked so incredibly hard at serving, bussing, and bartending it was impressive. However, it made the experience feel stressful and rushed. I made the best of it because I didn't want to ruin such a monumental party with our closest friends, but I left with a bit in my stomach about how everything had gone down. Most of all the treatment of my guests. It was embarrassing to say the least.
I will NEVER return to this restaurant for dinner, and I recommend at the very least, you should avoid having any of your treasured life time events at such a mismanaged place.
10 years of keep their lights on at times, is over.","Alec F.","I've been Picolinos a few times before and have always been pleased with the food, atmosphere and wait service. Although my go-to dish of choice is usually the gnocchi, on this occasion I tried house made ravioli special and was glad I did; I can't remember the last time I had such delicious raviolis.
Not only was the food great, but the whole restaurant was transformed into a Christmas wonderland - I felt as though I was having dinner on the stage of the Nutcracker by Sendak.
The wine pairing suggested by the waiter went well with the ravioli... and my friend and I enjoyed the after dinner cappuccino, tiramisu and cannolis.
The only issue I had was that it seemed like the dining space was a little more cramped than normal - as every time the wait staff passed behind me, my chair would wind up getting bumped.","Amandeep S.","I've been meaning to write a review for a while because Picolinos truly deserves the credit.
This is by far the BEST Italian food outside of Italy that I have had. My husband and I have been coming here for about 5 years now - mostly for special occasions - and it's still one of our favorite restaurants.
We recently came to celebrate my husband's birthday here and had yet again, a wonderful time! I made reservations a few days before and we were seated on their patio, which is filled with lots of plants, beautiful flowers and some decorative statues. You don't for a second feel like you're in Seattle!
Our server greeted us right away - he was SO friendly and took good care of us the whole evening. We got their bread and fresh pesto, which they make in house. They have a different specials menu each day so we started off with a salad off that menu, which consisted of butter lettuce, nectarines, berries and pistachios - it was absolutely delicious! And perfect for sharing :)
For our main course, I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara, which I had been craving for a really long time, and my husband had the Spaghetti con Polpette (essentially spaghetti with meatballs). I have to say that I wish the carbonara was a little more creamy, because it turned out a little dry for my liking. But my husband enjoyed it and his dish as well.
And since it was my husband's birthday, our server brought out a free tiramisu on the house, with a little candle, so it was a really cute way for the restaurant to help us celebrate :)
I can't rave enough about this place, and am already looking forward to coming back!","Marie B.","Time for an updated review! It has been nearly two years to the day from my last visit to Ristorante Piccolino's.
This is a long time Seattle favorite in the Ballard/Sunset Hill neighborhood. Established, polished, refined, but without the stuffiness. Often a reliable spot for celebratory get togethers, socializing at the bar, family meals, and date night. It also has an adjacent bakery and cafe and expansive terrace area.
Three months ago, tried to dine with the MKE Yelper in search of tiramisu. But the entire restaurant was closed for a film shoot with Hollywood stars TS and MS. Can't divulge this as it is a work in progress.
Returned this evening (9/15/19) with The Homie and was lucky to find nearby street parking and snag a two top without prior reservations made. With two newish establishments across the street, Samara and Baker's, parking can be a bit of a challenge.
From the host, our waitperson, and support dining staff, highly attentive service is provided. Menus, ice water, wine list, and bread service are provided upon being seated. Towards the end of the meal, another waitperson came over to say hello. She remembered us from visits 2 and 3 years ago!
We started with the Antipasto Misto Classico ($16), a generous array of marinated/grilled zucchini, peppers, mushrooms, artichokes, tomatoes, olives, assorted cheeses and meats.
The Homie surprisingly went with a generous bowl of Rigatoni Salsiccia ($22.50) versus his usual Spaghetti Carbonara. Thick slices of Italian sausage simmered with a flavorful tomato sauce. Enough to box up that he will definitely have a delicious lunch tomorrow.
I ordered one of the featured dinner specials, Wild Forest Mushroom Ravioli ($23). Handmade ravioli with a trio of mushrooms in a cream sauce. I greatly appreciated that it was not heavy or salty. I savored this at Piccolino's, but admit to finishing the remainder while writing this updated post, patting my chubby tummy.
Wrapped up dinner with an espresso ($3) and Cheesecake ($8) for dessert. Again, The Homie didn't go with his usual gelato, made from a very old family recipe.
Me - definitely the tiramisu, no surprise ($8). Wish the layers were soaked just a tad more in espresso or coffee liqueur though. Delicious nevertheless and savored slowly.
Yes, a definite culinary splurge in a lovely dining setting. Makes one's visit a bit more special. But added bonus for consistent and well polished service plus palate pleasing cuisine, this is worth every dollar!
Definitely recommended!","Julia A.","My husband was really craving Italian one night and wanted to take me to this place - my favorite cuisine is Italian so I was excited right away, and rightfully so!
We arrived a couple minutes late from our reservation time, so it took about an extra 10 minutes for us to be seated at our table. Boy, were they BUSY the evening we came here for dinner! We didn't actually have the server come to our table to take our drinks/appetizers order until at least 10-15 minutes after we were seated. Most of the time, we would be very impatient at this point, but we did see how busy they were that evening and saw plenty of servers running around frantically, so we were okay with waiting. We ordered the Bruschetta di Pomodoro for an appetizer - absolutely delicious! We also ordered an appetizer off the specials menu (for the life of me I cannot remember the dish name) but sadly they were sold out of it. :(
For entrees, I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara and my husband ordered the Spaghetti Con Polpette. The Carbonara was absolutely delicious. But I will say there are few restaurants that make Carbonara truly the way it should be made (sadly Picolinos does not make it in the proper way) but it is still very delicious. My husband also LOVED the Spaghetti - he loves lamb and I'm not a big fan of lamb. His comment to the lamb meatballs was ""it is very lamb-y"", haha!
We truly enjoyed our dinner experience here, despite the longer than usual (I'm sure) wait times. I'm excited to come back here again!","Thomas R.","Picolino's back garden bar is the perfect weekend hideout when you're needing an escape from the noise and congestion that has become Seattle.
You may have already heard that Picolinos offers great pasta, especially their spaghetti carbonara, which is so good that if you stick some on your forehead, your tongue'll slap your brains out trying to get to it. Honest! I've eaten here many times (just never in the garden) and it has always been good.
Now, let's get back to that bar in the back.
The garden bar is only open on weekends during warmer weather, which is prime time to sit and sip and forget everything. Nobody's going to rush you back here. Have a couple of Negronis or some beer before moving on to wine with dinner like we did. Gloria Gaynor and the Village People are playing in the background. I love this place.
The super-friendly bartender on duty last Friday was a real kick. This funny guy never intruded, but made us feel right at home. Scruffy barman would make some clever remark while resting his forearm on his knee after propping up his foot on something behind the bar and we would all laugh.
I like a barkeep who acts like he owns the place (or maybe he does?) yet never gets pushy or tries to sell you on something. He never asked us anything stupid like, ""would you like a salad with that?"" or ""how is everything tasting?"" This guy is a pro. His only unsolicited questions were ""what'll it be guys?"" and later on, ""how're you doing?""
Although quiet and unobtrusive, he was always visible, so if we wanted something, we only needed to flag him down.
His bar service alone receives 5 perfect golden A+ stars.
Oh yeah, and the food is delicious, too. Did I mention the carbonara? You're going to want some of that.
I'm so lucky I can walk here and stumble home. You should get a lyft or a cab if you can't hoof it, but do come here and sit in the back bar. It'll be one of your favorite new spots. I know it's one of mine.","Jenny G.","Our most favorite restaurant in the city. Warm and inviting and delicious food. Our go to restaurant. Even after our trip to Italy we thought the food here rivaled everything we had in Italy.","Anusha B.","Great service, good ambience and excellent food. One of the best Italian places I have been to in town.
Came here for my friend's birthday dinner and had an amazing time. He had a reservation for 8 people, and got a booking easily.
We wanted to get a seat outside, but they had closed the outside area due to the weather. That was the only bummer for us in the whole experience.
The food and service was excellent. They had an elaborate specials menu, and they also did a custom order of truffle oil pasta for my friend. The rigatoni, wild mushroom ravioli and gnocchi were super appetizing but the custom truffle oil pasta was amazingly delicious. We didn't order a wood fired pizza and desserts. But I'm definitely gonna try that in my next visit.
This place is nested in a residential area in Ballard. It was easy to find parking on weekdays. I am guessing this place is packed on weekends.","Novani M.","We had our wedding dinner at Picollinos. We loved our food and the ambiance was excellent. Loved the patio, even though we decided to have dinner inside. Everybody loved the place and their food.
The service was excellent. My friend is the pastry chef there and she made us the wedding cake which was fabulous. Thank's Vicky! Totally a cute restaurant and one of our favorites.","Josh P.","So this is a few months late as I recently decided Id love to give feedback on the places I've been to, both good and bad. Picolinos would fall under the GREAT category, If I lived down the road id be there 2-3 times a week if not more. However I have been there half a dozen times every time the experience is spectacular, ive recommended this place to so many.
Lets start with the atmosphere not your typical atmosphere very rustic and unique which I like, especially at night time. Great date night spot as it has a very romantic atmosphere, first time I was there I spent 3 hours on a date just enjoying this place.
The food ive had is incredible, would very much recommend the Margherita pizza as an appetizer and as for the entree I can only give a personal recommendation for the Pork Belly Ravioli as its the only thing ive ordered just with how good it is, I get it every time. Although others I have gone with have complimented how amazing their dish was so I can only assume their entire menu is just as delicious as the one I order is.
As for the drinks ive had, they make one of the best old fashioned around and I know my old fashioned. I have had a few of their wines as they do have a very extensive wine list.
With all that being said, I would highly recommend experiencing Picolinos for yourself, you will not be disappointed and this wasn't just a one time experience and review for me, ive been a number of times and im still blown away by this place, if you love Italian food, you need to check this place out.","Cait R.","AMAZING! I wish I could give this place 10 stars! Definitely try the goat cheese/ricotta ravioli or the spaghetti carbonara.","Savannah S.","Classic Italian food in a beautiful setting with friendly service!
It has a true italian vibe and ambiance. The patio is beautiful!
The pizza is incredible!!! The pasta is similarly top-notch. Overall a large menu and wine selection. Would definitely return, especially for the pizza!","Kenny S.","We stopped by here the other night on the way home from the locks. A word to the wise if you go in through the door to the most right, you have entered the breakfast and lunch counter and you don't spot that, they may tell you they are closed not realizing you came for dinner next door.
Once we got past that, we were treated by a friendly staff with more than the minimum of on duty folks.
Each of got a bread basket which is nice as some places charge extra for a few slices of sub par bread, not here.
Caesar salad was ample and nicely dressed.
If toy want traditional carbonara, they leave out the eggs, but still call it by the traditional name. It's good, but it isn't carbonara.
The other dish was a puttanesca which could have done with more traditional olives and capers but was still quite good.
Both dishes were ample and a good value for the price which made for left overs the next day.
Get there early as even on a week night it was busy.","Bryce B.","Reminiscent of the kind of Italian restaurants you'd find in homey NYC neighborhoods. Although quite roomy, it still manages to feel very cozy inside, with decor reminiscent of your grandmother's house. Service is friendly and personal, they really make you feel at home.
Sure, there are meat dishes on the menu, but this is a place that clearly takes its pasta seriously. You want to come here on a carb cheat day. Picolinos is, and deservedly so, known for their housemade raviolis. But realistically, you can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes. The Rigatoni Salsiccia and Spaghetti Con Frutti di Mare are both outstanding. Even the pizza is pretty good, but it's best as an appetizer for a table of four. Not sure I'd make a meal out of just that.
Dessert? Tiramisu is top notch. I wouldn't bother with anything else when this is so good.
They even have live music on occasion. Wine list is dominated by Italian varietals and PNW selections.","Ben W.","Simply not restaurant quality. Pizza was flop city - cheese and toppings slid right off. Carbonara was under sauced and noodles were over cooked.
Unfortunate to pay $50 for this meal, and honestly dissapointed in the yelp community. There is no chance this place is 4 stars. Y'all need to tighten it up.
Only positive is the outdoor seating area.
Will not be returning.","Tracy J.","Wow. How do I describe Picolinos ... I have spent so much time at this restaurant with my family for quiet celebrations or to have a cup of coffee in their European style coffee nook.
Piccolino's is an extremely large brick building in a quiet Ballard neighborhood. When you walk in it is quite dark. The tables are set with heavy silver. The tables are dark wood, And restaurant is split up into 2 or 3 different dining areas which gives it a cozy, intimate feeling. There's also a full service bar.
But my favorite place to go is the outdoor patio in back of the building. It's a huge outdoor patio. It's also landscaped as a garden. There are potted plants everywhere and draping vines and flowers. I've never seen another outdoor dining space in Seattle that is so beautiful. It's like having dinner in someones garden. There's also a tented outdoor seating section with a Moroccan feel. Dark drapes and very spacious. If you can't decide if you want to dine inside or outside, that area would be a great compromise. At any rate, wherever you sit it will be an experience. As for the food, I would take the rating down to 4 stars. I haven't had anything on the menu that I really loved. The foods okay. I think their menu could be reworked to provide more vegetarian options. But we don't go there for the food. We go there for the atsmosphere.","Ben C.","Absolutely wonderful experience and some of my favorite food that I've had in Seattle. My girlfriend and I went to the restaurant last night to catch an early dinner before going to a musical. Though we had a reservation, we were given the option to sit either inside or outside, of which we chose the latter.
The outdoor garden is absolutely beautiful. It made me feel far removed from the hustle and bustle of actual Seattle living.
We each ordered a wine which was very fairly priced. Bottle and premium wine options seemed like a reasonable markup when compared to the normal 3-4x you see. My girlfriend ordered the pork belly ravioli and I ordered the special lamb ravioli, both of which were absolutely amazing. The pork belly ravioli was very rich with a non-overpowering amount of white truffle oil included.
Very happy to have eaten here and I look forward to my next experience.","Shubhayu R.","Went here for a friends birthday dinner. Horrible service. Waiter didn't take food orders until we had to walk up and ask for them to take it. Seated at 7:30, food order taken at 9:40 after reminding the server twice!! They misplaced the orders and came back 30 mins later going around the table telling them their ordered dish was no longer available. Guess the table next to us ordered and had the last plate ahead of us. The bill was never updated so we still payed for the original stuff. If u have a party larger than 2 avoid this place.","Swagata R.","Horrible food and service!We went in at 7:30 pm and the waitor only took our drinks order at 8:30 pm anf food order at 9 pm. At 9:20 pm he told us half of what we ordered is not available. Food tasted bland. One or two of the pasta dishes tasted good."
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dave C.","So very glad this outstanding restaurant has settled into the historic Homestead Cabin just off Alki Beach.
We've had three meals now, no easy feat given the intense demand for reservations since they opened last summer. They all were among the very best we've had in Seattle. The pasta dishes change frequently and are all beautifully textured and popping with fresh fresh flavors, perfectly sauced. The antipasto are mostly light and bright; I have no idea how they source such extraordinary ingredients in the dead of winter. And the primi & secondi are all prepared so perfectly (so far) - the ribeye with a light, crispy crust containing stunning fatty bursts with each bite - the lamb beautifully prepared with the most delicately fruity/minty sauce - the black cod or salmon also beautifully sauced.
Service is elegantly casual, and the selection of wine is wonderful. Cocktails are also so well prepared.
I have no idea how this place is rated only 4 stars - this place is of the caliber of Salare, Cafe Juanita, and Canlis.","Joline T.","TL;DR Chef makes the simple things shine
Reservations: Seriously prohibitive and a pain. Reservations are open 30 days at a time. Reservations open at midnight. Had to book a month out at 12:01 am.
Parking: There's a lot right next door to the building. Signs will say parking for Homestead only; that's for Il Nido at the Homestead.
Burrata and prosciutto: Burrata was incredibly fresh and light, prosciutto was beautifully delicate and perfectly salty paired with the fresh burrata. Hands down the best prosciutto I've ever had.
Tagliatelle with bolognese: Tagliatelle was a little more al dente than I've had at other places; I loved the chew. I hate to compare it to Il Corvo, but how do you not? I also haven't been to Il Corvo for a couple years now because the line is impossible now. Based on my v distant memory, Il Corvo was just as good for half the price. But since I can't get Il Corvo anymore, then I'll pay for chef's pasta at Il Nido.
Cauliflower steak: it was fine. Gorgonzola was an interesting pairing that I've never had before. Gorgonzola wasn't overwhelming, but it was too much for me. That's a very personal taste thing though.
Pork cheeks with dried pear slices and polenta: Pork cheeks were didnt-need-a-fork tender. The sweetness of the pear complemented the earthiness of the pork cheeks. The polenta was the best I ever had. Crispy on the outside, fluffy soft the inside. Nice cheese flavor without being cheesy.
Would def come back!","Parisa E.","Il Nido is truly what an Italian experience should be! Cozy, fresh, and wanting more!
Getting reservations are tough (1 month in advance and opens at midnight). Once you dine there the hostess will ask if you want to make more reservations so we made 2 more 3-4 months in advance. I thought this was a really nice touch making them value their customers!
Food was amazing and pasta was cooked perfectly! I was really surprised and amazed by the desert both the taste and presentation! The log cabin is so cozy and perfect for a night out!","Sylvia K.","We were able to snag last minutes reservations for two on the Resy site on the day of (there was a cancellation!) at 8pm. We've been wanting to eat at Il Nido for months since it opened. The Resy site was easy to use and we got an email confirmation plus a text reminder an hour before our reservation.
We arrived a few minutes early (there's a small parking lot but we easily found street parking - Alki in winter is a lot less busy) and the host seated us right away. The historic Alki Homestead building has been beautifully restored. The interior is gorgeous and because it's December there were Christmas decorations which was lovely.
Our server Chad came over and told us the special (which was a cheese plate) and gave us some time to look over the menu. Everything on the menu sounded good. We decided on the special cheese plate (which came with a soft cheese from Cowgirl Creamery), the sage pappardelle in rabbit sugo, and the cider braised pork cheek. We asked the server to recommend a wine to go with our dinner and he suggested the arneis.
The arneis wine was lovely and paired well with our food. The cheese plate was yummy - the cheese was good and the housemade quince paste was delicious. Our pasta dish was my favorite part of the meal. The sage pappardelle was amazing and cooked perfectly. The rabbit meat was tender (and plentiful) and the sauce was light tasty. The pork cheek was also delicious and the flavor was great and the meat was also really tender (didn't even need a knife!). This polenta cake came with the pork cheek and that was super salty. Not sure if they just added too much salt or they added enough salt but didn't account for the polenta soaking up additional sauce, but it was way too salty.
Overall, the meal was delicious - the pasta and the proteins were good and the service was excellent, and the ambiance was perfect. I loved the log cabin interior and the christmas decorations. The only reason I couldn't give a full five stars was because of the overly salty polenta cake. For the prices and for the difficulty of getting reservations, I would expect all the food to be perfect. I'll definitely come back for the pasta (if we can somehow get reservations again)!","Jacqueline H.","I was so excited to go to Il Nido because I am a huge Il Corvo fan. It's a bit difficult to make reservations, but was able to get a table for a Thursday night. The restaurant is in a very cute log cabin-esque venue and is super cozy when you go inside. Service was amazing the whole night and they even took our coats and bags when we sat. They have different specials each night, which is introduced by the server who was very helpful and checked in multiple times throughout our meal. We tried the bruschetta, which is delicious and fatty - I would recommend getting a salad as an appetizer though because it'll help balance out the carbs later. We also ordered the ragu pasta and pesto pasta. I think these are always on the menu, but they were both delicious and perfectly cooked, much like at Il Corvo. Lastly, we ordered the tiramisu, which honestly was not that good. I wouldn't order it again. Despite that, the rest of the food was incredible and service was top notch. Would highly recommend coming in, especially if you want a high quality dining experience!","Marie B.","I am behind in my Yelp reviews coming up on one year, however, despite that sleep eludes me, I am compelled to post a Yelp review for Il Nido (10/9/19).
Big fan of pretty much whatever project Chef Mike Easton, his wife Victoria, and their team are involved in....from the early days of Bizarro, Lecosho, and when Il Corvo was sharing space with a gelato shop at the Pike Place Market Hillclimb. Well before those infamous weekday lines on James between 2nd and 3rd Avenues.
Since I'm a northender and work way up in North Lynnwood for 4.5 years, it is rare to have that amazing bowl of pasta, that kale salad, the proscuitto/pickled celery plate, selection of olives, and/or the delicious shortbread cookies from Il Corvo.
There are plenty of other worthy sites all over the city, but with traffic, parking, budget, and other logistics, sometimes having amazing hand crafted pasta takes major strategic planning.
I was among the masses awaiting the restoration of the Alki Homestead and the opening of Il Nido. Wasn't among the first to dine in mid May though and regretfully had to cancel a reservation in June. Then to learn it's booked a month or so out, are you f-ing kidding me?
Spring and summer flies by. Autumn is well underway with the colorful foliage and brisk breeze.
On a whim, turned my attention to the Resy site yesterday to see if I can nail a unicorn reservation to Il Nido. I literally had to blink in disbelief at six available slots for today. Time to check it out, and see why Yelp reviews run the entire spectrum, and why the wide disparity?
I left my home with a two hour cushion to make that trek to West Seattle. Not bad, in 30 minutes I was exiting off the bridge onto Harbor Avenue. Beautiful views of the water and the downtown Seattle skyline, I periodically stopped to admire and photograph. Located Il Nido (see posted tip) and a parking space right out front, then basked in the sun.
They don't unlock the main entrance until 5pm sharp. So I had an opportunity to admire the building exterior and well kept garden beds, plus chat with a trio of other women seated at the front bench. More folks also started appearing on the porch. Nice and orderly we all entered, thankfully no Black Friday-like pushing and shoving.
Once inside taking it all in, very aesthetically pleasing, and an amazing interior restoration. I had a brief flashback to two Willows Inn visits with the similarities of welcoming warmth, natural light, and lots of focal points.
Checked in at the host stand and was promptly brought to a two top, where I was taken care of by Chad and his other Il Nido colleagues. I was pleased to learn that the seasonal menu recently had changed, but passed on this evening's special of rabbit. ""Thumper"" at Cafe Juanita nearly two decades ago still gives me PTSD.
So here's the run down of what I indulged in:
*Rubicon ($14) Bourbon, black walnut bitters, fig sugar, on the rocks. Nice strong and smooth cocktail.
*Contorni ($11) Mixed chicories salad with anchovy dressing, perfectly soft boiled egg, and copious parmigiano atop. Wish the greens weren't quite so cold temperature wise, but ate about a third with the egg. Kindly the rest was boxed up.
*Primi Pasta ($24) Lumache, winter squash cream, crisp fried sage, and cookie dust. Delicious seasonal pasta. This is where others balk at either the pasta prices, quantity, or both. I ate half with all the sage leaves. Again, kindly the rest was boxed up.
*Secondi Bistecca Ribeye ($49) requested medium rare and served atop tender salad greens. The juices on the greens were spot on tasty. I was blown away by the quality, preparation, and presentation of the ribeye steak. Perfectly seasoned, juicy, tender...barely didn't need the steak knife provided. Again, ate half with all the salad greens. Yes, another box filled.
*Savored the ribeye with a glass of 2016 Avennia Gravura ($16/glass) a full bodied Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc from Columbia Valley. The pour definitely complemented the steak.
*For dessert, Espresso with biscotti ($3) and the Chocolate Salami dessert special ($10) added the exclamation point to my dinner. Slices of chocolate speckled with ladyfingers to mimic the salami, served in addition with hazelnut brittle, plum and apple slices, and a berry compote. Nicely composed, not cloying, and terrific flavors and textures.
I enjoyed my brief exchanges with the wait staff throughout my meal and the host staff upon departing. I dined alone, but was well attended to and the entire meal was well paced.
Il Nido is an impressive neighborhood gem, fresh seasonal items showcased from local purveyors, spot on professional service, contributing to an overall, thoroughly enjoyable dining experience.","Huong L.","I was super excited about this place when i first heard about it. I even woke up at like 3am to try to get reservations... I guess my expectation was too high that it was kind of a let down...
The place itself is very rustic and homey so it was a mix between being casual and fancy.
As you get seated, your server comes over to explain the menu as it change frequently, which is nice. We ended up getting following:
the special of the day which is a papadel noodle with a rabbit ragu - the pasta here is the same as il corvo - perfectly cooked, great flavors, but 2-3x more expensive than il corvo...
the quail wrapped with bacon - this was a very well balanced dish, the quail wrapped in bacon was cooked perfectly, and it was savory and rich, which was balanced out by some vibrant greens and plums.
braised green dish - did not expect this dish to be so southern style. It was kinda heavy and more beans than braised green, also kinda bland.
Poached pear in red wine with crumble - pretty good. You get a nice surprise when you cut the pear open as it is filled with cream. Also very light and not super sweet.
In summary, the food was ok, some good, some ok, but nothing extraordinary. The pasta was perfect but I rather wait at il corvo as it is cheaper and you can get more options. The wait for food here was almost as long which confuse me because they have an idea of how many people will be here through reservation so I don't know why it took so long for food to come out (it took almost 30 minutes for our dessert!)
The highlight of my meal??? The little biscotti sample they gave at the very end. It was probably the best biscotti I ever eaten. But they gave us 1.5 bitr pieces for 2 people...not sure what that is about either ..","Julia C.","We were so excited to get a reservation here because of all the hype.
A little underwhelmed, nothing was bad but wouldn't say anything was amazing either. Pastas were all cooked perfectly, the bucatini was definitely our favorite dish. I would say it is worth checking out as I believe their dishes change continuously based on the seasons. Glad we came and tried Il Nido, it was worth the trek to West Seattle ;)","Julie P.","Great atmosphere, good service & delicious food! I'm a fan!
Everything we tried here was very good but the only thing that was a little disappointing was the portion was a bit lacking compared to other Italian restaurants, especially because it is on the pricier side.
We got the Castelvetrano Foccacia Bread to start off (unfortunately, bread does not come with the meal hahah) but man, it was worth paying for it because it was delicious.
We also tried the Rigatoni Nero & the Wild Boar Tagliatelle. The tagliatelle was cooked to perfection! It was so good - I think this was my favorite dish! The Rigatoni Nero lacked sauce - the pasta was a bit dry, but I did like that there was a lot of octopus in the dish. The Wood-grilled Saddle of Lamb was really yummy but it was pretty small! Haha I must have been super hungry. We finished our meal with Tiramisu dessert! My all time favorite and it did not disappoint!
Overall, I would definitely recommend everyone to try this place at least once! I will definitely come back for special occasions - IF we can get a reservation! They book out months in advance... We got super lucky and came here on the week of their opening because my friend ending up giving me her reservation! :) Thanks Il Nido - we had a great experience here.","Rebecca T.","My boyfriend was able to snag us a table at il Nido the day of after waiting on the waitlist for a while- so don't give up!!
I am a huge fan of il corvo so of course when I heard about il nido opening up, I desperately needed to try it! The menu seemed to have rotated recently so I have the updated menu below!
For starters we ordered the chicories salad and bruschetta al lardo. Both were absolutely delicious! Fair warning, the chicories salad was pretty bitter so if you don't like bitter tastes don't get it! The bruschetta was sooo good. The bread was very fresh & the butter was so creamy!
For pastas, we ordered the rigatoni with braiseed beef & the bucatini with pork. The pasta was cooked very al dente just like how they do it over at il corvo. The beef sauce was pretty heavy and packed full of flavors. There were big beef chunks in it too! The bucatini had little pork pieces and was definitely a lot less strong but still very flavorful as well. I'm glad I was able to have a little of both for some balance. The pasta portions were the same as il corvo's!
For dessert we had the tiramisu which was pretty good (nothing special though!)","Silvia V.","Amazing place!!
Reservation recommended if you want to sit in the restaurant or there is a small bar for 2-people party. Without reservation you may have to wait for a while.
The food: delicate, flavorful, and beautiful! We had wine and a full menu with appetizers, entrees (lamb and pasta), dessert and coffee. Really great!
Service: impeccable! Friendly host and nice waiter.
Price: totally appropriate for the quality you get. It is on the fancy date side but definitely worth every penny!
Atmosphere: calm and perfect for conversations!
Just an outstanding place and a gem in the area!!
Thanks for the beautiful experience!
Silvia & Joel","Laura C.","A bit of a let down compared to Il Corvo. In general, expectations were very high coming to this restaurant hoping the pasta would be the same as their lunch spot.
The meal was quite unmemorable, but I remember the dishes being very small and the pastas not living up to what they serve at Il Corvo. For what you pay in price, I would expect a bit more from Il Nido.","Robyn C.","Went here for opening night with high expectations. I knew the pasta was going to be great, but I had one question... is it worth it? Yes. The service was great. Our server actually engaged with us about the menu rather than just telling us ""the special"" and the usual ""thanks for joining us"".
Small menu but, the dishes were well executed.
The octopus rigatoni was 5/5!! A heaping portion of baby octopus, pasta and oh man- the spices. I try not order squid, octopus or even scallops at restaurants because it tends to be over cooked, but I'm really glad I gave it a go! Also tried the trout. The olives and the fennel really enhanced the flavor of the fish.
Then came the tiramisu. It wasn't as ""soaked"" as I would've liked, which made the flavor more like just any other ""coffee cake"". I wasn't so sure about the chocolate garnish because it just ended up bigger than the actual tiramisu... was it supposed to be a shell? I'm not sure.
All in all, it was good food. The ocean view near by isn't so bad either.","Emily J.","When the reservations opened for Il Nido, I immediately jumped on resy to book for a weekend night. Looking back on it, I am glad I did because when I was debating moving it, all the reservations for June were taken.
Having been to Il Corvo one time before, I kinda knew what I was getting myself into by going here. If you are unfamiliar with their style, which I assume you aren't since you are on their yelp page, you now know what type of menu they have and what their dishes look like.
The prices are not low. I would not come here on a budget or thinking you are going to get quantity or quality. You are going here for the quality.
Reviewing the menu, each dish seems thoughtfully put together and you can see that in the presentation as each of your items gets placed onto your table.
For my date night, we started off with a drink. I asked for a fruity suggestion and ended up ordering the Cool Waves. It was definitely fruity, somewhat strong, and very tasty.
For the appetizer, we ordered the burrata and the 24 month prosciutto. If you have never had a burrata before, it is a fresh Italian milk cheese. When you see it, you probably are thinking rich and dense but it is actually what I would consider light, clean, and subtle. A very delicate flavor in my opinion. If you cannot handle dairy or are not a fan of milk, maybe skip it, otherwise I would recommend. The prosciutto was kinda gamey? A unique taste and little on the salty side.
The main course items we chose were the ricotta cavatieddi, roman style pomodoro and the wood grilled saddle lamb, corona beans, charred spring onions, peas. I, obviously, chose the pasta. It was exactly what I was expecting. Really good and I could of ate a huge portion of it. It was the perfect size if you had an appetizer before. If you did not, you would probably consider it small. The wood grilled saddle lamb was delicious. It melt in your mouth and had great flavor. The beans on the other hand, were just okay.
Overall, the meal was good but pricey. If you need to eat a ton, be ready to open up your wallet. Would I go back? Definitely! But only if other people wanted to go.
Parking - They do have a few spaces on the left, if you are driving by and facing the restaurant. They seem like they are normally open if you have either the 5pm or 5:30 pm reservation. If you have a later reservation, fingers crossed that you get a spot or else you get the joy of driving around alkai looking for street parking.","Kirstie C.","I basically love everything about this place from the location, the architecture, mood/ambiance, decor, and especially the food.
Love that they tie in seasonal items to their menu along with specials that change so you get a good variety to choose from. I definitely recommend this spot and will be going back for sure.","Ben C.","I haven't look forward to a restaurant opening since I lived in Washington DC about two years ago. Il Nido is the sit-down restaurant cousin of the famed Il Corvo walk-up Italian lunch spot in Pioneer Square.
I've followed the restaurant's development on Instagram and I have to say that it's one of the most beautifully designed and spacious restaurants that I've been to. Maybe it's just because they're getting a feel for running operations and don't want to overwhelm themselves but I appreciate not having to trip over chairs walking around the main dining area.
The menu consists of a handful of appetizers, four pasta dishes, a selection of salads, and three 'secondi' main dishes. The chef handmakes each pasta that goes on the night's menu-- the wheat berries used to make the cornetti were even toasted prior to grinding.
The focaccia was quite possibly even better than the one at Il Corvo-- for the first time in my life I actually ate an olive and enjoyed it. The staff encourage you to share dishes family-style so as to get enough of a taste of everything. All pasta was amazing, but I found a couple of the dishes to be served a bit colder than I would have hoped for. The dessert was out of this world good-- the tiramisu was utterly delicate and the panna cotta made me roll the eyes into the back of my head.
I'm really excited for this restaurant and am super interested to see how it develops over the coming years!","Maddie E.","Is this place all it's cracked up to be? Yes, and then some. I've been lucky enough to come here twice in the past three months. Getting a reservation is tough and you have to be flexible with your dates/times, even if that means eating dinner at 9pm. The service is absolutely five stars and the ever-changing menu brings new surprises each visit. Can't wait for my next trip in February!","Audrey C.","I cannot believe how difficult it was to get reservations here... I literally had to check back almost every day to see if anyone had cancelled and it still took a couple weeks. In the end we had a great experience and the food was delicious, but definitely on the pricier side for West Seattle. That said, given how busy this place is, I think there is plenty of demand for a littler pricier dining in West Seattle. I mean, how many more pizza places do we need?
We ordered a bottle of wine, two drinks, two pastas, burrata & 24 month prosciutto, focaccia, lamb, and tiramisu, and that was plenty and bit overkill for the two of us. But if you wait for that long to try a place, you might as well try as much as you can. I think our bill ended up being $260 including tip, so I would put it on the special occasion list or a couple times a year list. There are some lower priced Italian options in West Seattle that offer some pretty decent handmade pasta as well, but this place seemed like a level above and the service was really good.
Overall, will definitely be back to try it out again once things have died down a bit and reservations are easier.
Note- there is a bar which I assume is walk-up and you can order off their main menu, but can't confirm. There were a limited number of seats at the bar, maybe 8-10","Tuan N.","I'll preface this by saying it's more like 3.5*
We've been waiting for this place to open up seeing how much we loved Il Corvo, but tough to make it there only during lunches.
With Il Nido open for dinner, we can have more of a chance to have delicious pasta.
First off the building, decor was welcoming like a home and service was on point from the greet to sit down. Our server was honest about the food and gave suggestions about what he thought were the stars and which dishes might needs to be tweaked.
We had the bruschetta, king oyster mushroom, and two different pasta and a couple of drinks.
The bruschetta came with a lard spread that was delicious but the bread was so burnt, they actually took it off our bill and gave us focaccia bread.
The mushroom dish was a great appetizer with right amount of saltiness and earthiness. This restored my thought that it's going to be a great meal.
However, when the two pasta dish came out it was a tale of two pasta. The gemelli sauce was great but the pasta itself a bit overcooked and fell apart. The cavadetti texture was perfect but sauce could have used a bit more salt. Some small changes would have made them perfect like I'm used at at Il Corvo. Also, the portions were on a smaller side even for fine dining.
Overall, they just opened not so long ago so hopefully they work out the small missteps by the time we dine there again.","Alexis M.","Set my alarm for midnight exactly 30 days before the night I wanted to eat here to get the reservation on open table. Getting a reservation is a hassle, but it's definitely worth the wait. The service was amazing... one of the best I've experienced at any other restaurant in Seattle. The tables were all spaced out far apart, so each party had plenty of privacy. I saw people were raving about the focaccia, and it was good, but many other dishes were much more impressive. The ciccioli pork rillette antipasti dish was amazing!!! Our waiter described it to us as like an Italian Pâté. It was so tasty!!! The pasta dishes were all amazing as well. I had the sage pappardelle rabbit sugo. The pasta was cooked perfectly and you could really taste the sage!! My dad got the pasta special-- the scallops ravioli-- and he thought it was delicious, but I think he was even more impressed by the pork cheeks which came on some cheesy polenta. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!!!"
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Laura C.","Artusi is in my top 5 neighborhood spots, which is highly competitive on the Hill. It's taken me a long time to write this review, frankly because I want Artusi all to myself. The food is incredible and well priced, the service is informed and friendly, and the ambience is warm and cozy.
Food: My favorite always menu item is the meatball, it's on the HH menu and the dinner menu. Seriously, it's legit the best meatball of my life and I really try not to say that in my yelp reviews, but this one is seriously special. It's a little spicy, filling, and comes with a lovely piece of crusty bread. The pastas are made in-house and rotates seasonally. These guys service brunch too, and it's out of this world! The hash, the risotto, the bevvies! All legit.
Service: The staff here are friendly, warm, and experienced. They know their wine, make incredible cocktails, and make incredible recommendations. This is truly a neighborhood spot and this staff is what makes it really feel like home.","Jenny Z.","Had been here a few times moreso for drinks and apps, but this past Monday we came for dinner. The pasta and wine night is divine. It is 2 pastas and a bottle for $40. I get skeptical about house red wine because it's generally on the sweeter side but this cab was perfect. We had about a glass left and took it home and enjoyed it the next day.
The pasta... yum. We ordered tagliatelle and gnocchi. The tagliatelle was a chicken one which I had never had before but it was good. Almost a pot pie flavor. The gnocchi had mushrooms and may have been my favorite gnocchi dish ever. My husband hates mushrooms and was even picking out the mushrooms to eat specifically. So tasty.
We also had some olives and meatballs. Meatballs are $5 each on happy hour which are a little expensive since they're not huge - but nonetheless very tasty.
It was an ideal amount of food and because of pasta and wine night, not expensive at all for what you get. Definitely recommend! But do expect a wait unless you get there right at open for pasta and wine night. We got there at 5:30 pm expecting some bar seating but every seat was taken and we waited about 40 min. We just headed over to Elysian a couple blocks away for a drink - which I recommend as well!","Malia M.","WHY ARE YOU READING THIS INSTEAD OF EATING THE MEATBALLS ALREADY
Order 3 plates of meatballs because they're ridiculous.
I also rec the tagliatelle if its available when you're in
This place is insane in such a good way. Prices are reasonable.
Authentic, fresh and a chill environment. Great HH.
Drinks are strong, I love the seating in here and the paper lanterns.
Don't make the same mistakes I did: don't bring anyone here, including yourself, if the best Italian food you've/they've had is from Olive Garden. For example, if you're looking to bring your parents to a nice italian spot because they're paying for it, prepare for them to make some bad comments about really great food.","Mimi N.","Woohoo! Been here a few times and last night made me realize why Artusi is definitely a spot I would recommend as a worthy visit if you're in the Caphill area.
For Sunday/Monday nights - Come here and definitely check out the awesome Pasta Night special. At this time, it's a stellar deal of 2 pasta dishes + a bottle of wine (red/white/rose) for only $40! The earlier you show up, the shorter the wait. Came here around 5:30pm and snagging a table was pretty quick. By 630, entire restaurant (table/bar) was packed and wait time can vary between 30-45min+.
Food: Tried the special pasta with beef cheeks and this was absolutelyyyyy yummmms. Felt like the pasta melted in my mouth. Also, did try the Tonnarelli but wasn't a big fan of the noodles and texture. In the past, have tried the fried bread (so good!!!) and meatballs and these two remain consistently good. Overall, food here is yum and worth the visit.
Drinks: If you're not hungry but you're thirsty instead, check out the cocktails here! I tried a few drinks out and all were so so yummy. Can't go wrong with anything~~~~
In gist, love this spot for food and drinks. It's a bit of a walk from the hustle & bustle of Caphill but definitely worth it. Plus, if you want additional desserts, Regent Bakery is just right across the street.","Lynden L.","We came as a party of 2 a bit after 12:30pm on Sunday for their Brunch Special ($35 for 2 entrees and a cocktail pitcher).
We did not have a very long wait (only as long as it took them to set up the table) as we came in as most people were leaving (finding a parking spot in caphill on a sunday took much longer!) and quickly sat down at a nice little table next to the window. The Brunch Special is what it is and we ordered the Risotto, Benedicto, and Apricot Collins.
Everything was beautifully presented and our server even helped us pour our first drinks from the ""pitcher"" (not really a pitcher, probably has only around 3 small glasses worth of liquid, including ice). The risotto was very interesting as it has a vinegary/sour taste, but overall we still liked it with the bacon crumbles and raw egg yolk on top. However, we did find that as it was served as a thin layer on a very shallow plate, the risotto did get cold quickly as you ate it. The benedicto was also great, as I loved that they used foccacia in place of english muffin, which soaked up all the lovely hollandaise sauce and runny egg yolk. It seemed lighter than your normal eggs benedict and left you craving for more as opposed to stuffed full of greasiness.
The apricot collins was refreshing -- not too sweet and just the right amount of alcohol. And what a pretty color as well!
Overall, we loved our experience but the portion sizes (for both entrees and drinks) are definitely on the smaller side. But the $35 deal is definitely a reasonable price in the CapHill area. This is probably great for a girls' brunch but me being a girl still found myself hungry afterwards and had to make a stop at Bakery Nouveau for a chocolate croissant to round out my meal.","Marcela V.","This is one of my favorite spots to bring out of towners. It is Spinasse's sister restaurant, a little less expensive but just as good! They make all their pasta in-house and have some amazing plates. The best thing about Artusi is their pasta special on Sundays & Mondays. You can order two pastas and a bottle of wine for $40! It is a perfect place for date night. I definitely recommend coming early though because it's a small space and does full up quickly. The plates can be pretty small so I recommend ordering an appetizer or dessert to supplement the small portion size, but I can't complain too much when you're getting such a good deal. I will definitely continue to go to Artusi!","Derek M.","The sister-restaurant to Spinasse. Cozy seating area with small tables that won't seat more than 4 comfortably. Shares a restaurant menu with Spinasse which is easy to access through an open wall on the way to the restroom. Food is just as delicious as Spinasse but the menu feels a little more condensed. Definitely the over-flow bar when Spinasse gets busy, but still offers the same quality food and service for smaller groups trying to dine at Spinasse without a reservation. Food is top-notch but don't expect a large portion of food. This is the place to go if you don't have a reservation at Spinasse and you have a group of 5 or smaller.","Victoria C.","This is brunch only
Good service here.
The risotto is great and pretty flavorful. Portions are good sized - not too much and not too little.
Pancakes were pretty basic. I didnt think the pancakes tastes anything special. I wasnt too big fan of the eggs - I didnt taste the crab too much
They have 2 meals and pitcher deal - 35$. I'd say the pitcher is about 4 drinks. Spritzer wasnt too sweet.
No bloody Mary's here if anyone cares!","Mei P.","I came to Artusi because a friend of mine suggested it's Sunday and Monday's dinner special where you get two (2) pastas and a bottle- yes a bottle- of wine for $40 total. What a steal!
I got the Maltagliati pasta that was made with beef short rib and bf got the Beef ravioli special. We also ordered a side of bread ($2) with olive oil as a starter. I really liked my pasta. The beef was extra tender! And the pasta was wonderful! I just wish there was more.
For the wine, we ordered the rose which was delicious. Very crisp and refreshing! I like my rose to be on the dry side and the one that was on selection was perfect.
The 2 pastas and a bottle of wine special sounds like a good deal but it ends up just breaking even in my opinion. The pasta and wine were delicious but there just wasn't that much food, especially if you were hungry before hand. A good place for people with smaller appetites that want to share a bottle of nice wine for dinner but probably not substantial.","Ellen B.","I've only been to Artusi for brunch, but I'd love to return for dinner too. I was pleasantly surprised with my experience at brunch. I wouldn't recommend Artusi for large groups- but my friends and I always do it anyways because we like to suffer and wait for tables. We had a table of 6 and we all opted for the Special $30 two food items + cocktail pitcher and split them amongst two people. I'm not sure if this is designed for one person to have two dishes and a cocktail pitcher or for two people because the dishes are just a tad too small portion wise for a good meal. However, the bonus of a cocktail pitcher for only $30 total makes up for it. Most brunch places in Capitol Hill will be $15 for your meal + $11-15 for ONE mimosa on top of that so this is one of the much better value places in my opinion. The risotto and the hash are my favorites so I'd highly recommend those two.
We all ordered different cocktail pitchers so we could try them all. However, the waitress was adamant that the cocktails needed to be served in the correct glasses and that we couldn't share because it wasn't possible to pour them into other glasses. So... we did it anyways behind her back. That was kind of a weird experience, but the cocktail pitcher experience was fun and we all enjoyed ourselves.
Overall I can't wait to return to Artusi for brunch again and also to try dinner!","Daniel L.","Decided to try this place for happy hour on a weekday. Food is tasty but very pricy with tiny portions. Cost $5 for a single meatball, $12 for about 10 pieces of mini-ravioli. And the drinks are good but nothing special at high prices. Wouldn't recommend for happy hour as they didn't have good deals - it might be good for a date night though. We ended up going to another place after spending a lot of money here without getting full or drunk","JT T.","Artusi is definitely worth a visit for its pasta nights: 2 pastas (there are usually 3 or 4 on the menu) and a bottle of house wine for $40. This is a fantastic deal for the neighborhood and for the regular prices (~$20 for a pasta alone) at this establishment. That said, pastas (and all the dishes I saw) are pretty small, so order an appetizer or two if you're a normal amount hungry. The food itself is really nicely prepared and presented; everything was cooked well and had a good balance of flavors. Restaurant/bar is fairly small--for groups, I don't think they could seat a table of more than maybe 6-8 people--so go early on busy evenings (Friday through Monday)","Travis L.","Recently visited with a couple of friends. We had an assortment of the anti-pastas and we also ordered the three main pastas and the special, as well as the meatballs.
The burrata was pretty good, not a huge fan of the minced zucchini but throw it on some bread dipped in olive oil and cuts some of the sweetness. Really enjoyed the Fra'Mani salame della sera. I liked the pears sugary sweetness with the saltiness of the meats.
The Tonnarelli and the special pasta of the night were very on point but found the risotto to be salty and gnocchi a bit dense. However, aside from those two critiques the flavor profiles were forward and pleasant.
Finally, had the tiramisu (off menu) for desert, very light, would have preferred a stronger mascarpone and cocoa flavor.
The food came out at a decent pace but our server could be reminded she's in the service business.
Regardless, enjoyed the atmosphere and might return but would probably rather just go to Spinasse.","Enquan X.","Food was pretty nice!
Had Happy Hour sparkling and snack(pasta).
I ordered the steak as main. My friend said I'm the bitch haha.
The steak wasn't in the right temp , plate was cold, cold plate for mid-cocked steak. That's the pity ! Steak didn't have much seasonings over, I assume it would rely on the right temp and timing to bring the good flavor. A hot/warm plate can be a saver!
Dessert was pretty, would be good for two 2 share.
Personal thoughts","Shannon L.","Came here again - for happy hour this time. Maintaining the 4 star review. My biggest gripe is the portions are really small. My friend and I split the pasta of the day for $12 on HH and it was amazing, but very small. We also shared the fried bread and I was slightly underwhelmed by it. The prosciutto seemed more like turkey and I just found it more random than crafty and good. The house red we had from the happy hour was really good, too. Service pretty decent too. Just need to increase those portions!
Went for brunch today (a sunday) and overall a pleasant experience. First positive was that there wasn't a wait like there were for many other places in the area. On Sundays they have a special of $30 for 2 entrees and a pitcher (but really...a carafe) which was a decent deal. I would, however, warn that the entrees are not very big. I was content after eating but know several people who wouldn't have had enough with the smaller portions. Service was great though. Worg","Summer W.","The perfect date night! On Sunday and Monday night, Artusi gives you the choice of two entrees and a bottle of wine for $40. Between their ambiance and the delicious food, it's a recipe for a great night.
Whenever I see the gnocchi on the menu, I say YES! It's the perfect pillow of delicious dumpling goodness. Try it and you won't regret it.
Pros: great deal (if you come at the right time), delicious food, fantastic service
Cons: limited seating, street parking","Rosa K.","It was a Friday night and we were actually meaning to go to Cascina Spinasse next door, they said the wait was 1.5 hours! I look over and Artusi is literally next door! It was about 8:30pm and we were starving and I have been wanting to try out Artusi so we decided to go there for a drink and light bites.
I got a glass of red wine and my boyfriend got an old fashion.
We said light bites, but I think we were hungrier than we though. We ordered the potato gnocchi and the braised pork belly.
I have had gnocchi before but I usually pick pasta over the gnocchi so I wasn't expecting to be wowed but boy, was I wrong. The gnocchi was cooked perfect. It had the perfect bite to it- soft and chewy. The lamb ragu was delicious and went perfectly with the gnocchi.
I was excited to try the braised pork belly. I have never had pork belly that was this tender before. The pork belly just fell apart. It was so tender, soft and just melted in my mouth. The 6 minute egg- the yoke beautifully would ooze out onto the pork belly. The culmination of the rich egg and the pork belly was magical. I would go back just for this dish.","Alex M.","I had the Tonnarelli Corti and it was delicious. The only part I didn't like was the pork cheeks- just not a fan. I also had the ""As I Lay Drinking"" cocktail and definitely get if you're into gin!
But, our server was sooo rude at the end. We asked if we could split checks and she barely gave us the time of day to tell us that they don't do it for groups of 6 or more. I totally understand that it's a rule, but our waitress handled the situation poorly.","Beau S.","Artusi has brunch now!! It might be limited time but you get a pitcher of mixed drinks and 2 menu items for $30.. The pancetta risotto was cheesy delicious with a yolk in the middle. I also got the dutch baby which was good but a little small. Dinner is also really good with a good happy hour for food and drinks.","Kent L.","I got the risotto for 12 dollars. Definitely one of the best risottos I have had. Very flavorful, has some slight acidity that really went well with the dish. Egg yolk in the middle (though unsure if it added more flavor to the dish). Portions were a bit smaller than I would have hoped, but I could see myself returning for more."
"Tulio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tulio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Samuel B.","Came in for brunch on a rainy Saturday day and though I had been here before for lunch, I had never been for brunch. I was very pleasantly surprised.
I ordered the grilled rustic bread with the poached eggs and a coffee with Frangelico. The hollandaise was a bit lukewarm but the staff was immediately on it and did not just warm it up...the dish was remade! That's good service to me.
The decor is lovely, the waitstaff is attentive, and the food was delicious. Certainly worth the trip!","Sean T.","This place was expensive, which would be finif I got a decent ROI for my money... I didn't.
The food tasted like diner food.
The service was decent.
Place was empty which should have been our clue.","Danielle W.","I can not recommend this spot to anyone. We tried to appetizers, the burrata and the asparagus and both were not good. The asparagus was very crunchy and tasteless, we left most on the plate.
We tried the squid ink pasta and another red sauce based one.
The pastas were bland, and unfulfilling. We boxed our food to go, and I went to subway right afterward, and honestly it was better.
If you want good Italian, I suggest Alturo in Capitol Hill.","Lisa J.","I wanted to like this place since the food wasn't exactly bad and the place had a nice ambiance to it. But it was overpriced, service was lacking, portions too small, and they add a service charge to your bill (before tax)!
We had the sweet potato gnocchi as an appetizer to share. It was good but very small portion. For the main meal I had the clam linguine which was good but again, portion was small, the clams were teeny tiny, and barely any linguine underneath. I was left feeling HUNGRY (hangry).
My boyfriend ordered the ribeye with ""porcini potatoes"". He loves porcini mushrooms but was disappointed that there wasn't even a trace of porcini on the plate. The ribeye was good though.
We wanted to ask our waiter about the ""porcini potatoes"" but he never bothered to ask how our meal was. He walked by our table many times and never stopped to check on us at all! He only talked to us when he brought us the check- which included a service charge before taxes. For adding a service charge, this place did not deliver to a higher standard of service. Our waiter barely even did his job except bring us 3 plates of food.
Don't come here if you are hungry. This place is way too overpriced for mediocre Italian food","Yolanda S.","We've been passing by Tulio everyday on our way to work and finally had the pleasure to visit this establishment due to the proximity of the hotel we stayed in. We were only looking to have a nightcap so we sat at the bar and had the Finocchio Negroni cocktail. What a special concoction this was made with Fords gin, fennel campari, cynar, china china and orange bitters. It was so delicious I had two of them served by the most hospitable bartender named Leah. Another person in our party ordered the chicken. It was roasted with caramelized garlic and sage and served on lemon risotto. That is definitely on our list for the next time we visit and we are also looking forward to having brunch. Maybe we'll have the hand made biscuits and /or the handmade cinnamon roll. Can't wait!","Hyozzang C.","Came for brunch after friends recommendation. Thoroughly disappointed. Pasta was mediocre, brunch menu was subpar, service felt rushed. I substituted sausage for veggies in my pasta dish and what veggies?! Lol it was very laughable. Please tell me if you see any veggies in the red sauce pasta dish. There were tiny onions and 3 mushrooms. No offer of pepper or grated cheese. Isn't that standard?
In conclusion, everything was mediocre. Would not recommend and will not come back. You know that feeling when you go to a restaurant and you go through immediate feelings of regret because you dont want to eat the food, but it feels like a waste of money?","Dana R.","Tulio used to be one of my Seattle favorites for the smoked salmon ravioli with a super light lemon cream sauce and asparagus tips ... that dish went away and came back and is now gone again. While dining here most recently (about a year ago) Chef Pisano was in the dining room, I asked him whether there was a chance of the dish coming back ... I was surprised at the curt response ... no, our customers want healthier dishes ... really? Several items on the menu have butter, cheese, cream or crema sauces ... it's okay to good-naturedly say we want to change things up. Gotta be honest, it was a bit of a bummer interaction.
The sweet potato gnocchi used to be pillow soft but has been overworked and a bit tougher/gummier the last 2 times I've ordered it (the executive chef at Marco Canora's Hearth in NYC taught me how to make gnocchi and it's easy to overwork the potato dough).
The roasted chicken with caramelized garlic, sage and lemon risotto is fabulous. Rich, rich, rich.","Rachel R.","I ordered a cup of coffee and enjoyed the tremendous service, relaxing environment, and good company.","Lexi H.","Tulio reminds me a lot of old Italian restaurants on the East Coast - great use of wood, moulding, and quality materials while being a bit more 'buttoned up' than most restaurants in Seattle (even the 'fancier' ones).
We went for lunch on a Friday and while they were full, they were able to seat us in the bar. Service was prompt and friendly. We were almost immediately served four slices of soft bread with olive oil for dipping.
We ordered two glasses of Sauvignon Blanc, and I ordered the agnolotti and my co-worker ordered risotto. The food came out remarkably fast, and the agnolotti - OMG! YUM! At first, the use of lemon was a little overpowering in this creamy dish, but when paired with the cheese inside of the pasta, it was balanced very nicely. My co-worker enjoyed his risotto and we happily drank the sauv blanc (which was good, but a bit pricey per glass).
The environment here would make for a great place to bring someone when feeling a bit more upscale, or if you're on a date. The food was delicious, and I'm looking forward to going back and trying the full dinner menu.","Jay A.","So disappointed. I was here several years ago and had a creamy pasta dish with pork belly. It was luxuriant! I raved about it So I was eager to ordered it when I got into town, recently. Oof.
Really really unenjoyable. I kept putting salt on it to try and bring out some flavor but there was really nothing to work with. Very little sauce, dry pork belly. The worst part was that I talked someone else into ordering the same.Too many other wonderful options in the area to make me want to go back. Lesson learned.","Kathryn S.","Perhaps it is true that familiarity breeds contempt because, after our first breakfast at Tulio, I would have given Tulio a 4. But we ate four breakfasts here as well as three dinners. It's now down to a 3; meaning, average.
Let me start by stating that not one waitress (breakfast) or waiter (dinner), or the Bartender, introduced themselves. We asked one waiter (Shawn) his name; and we asked the Bartender (Leah) her name. No one told us their names.
I do like the Matre D. On one occasion, he told us which three tables he had available and let us chose. Another evening, he set a professional basketball player and her friend next to us. That was kind of cool.
The restaurant is pleasantly dark, lots of wood, very traditional and warm. Love the interior. However, getting in and out of the booths (which we did twice at breakfast) is hard; especially getting out of them. We then started asking for a table for breakfast. We had stuff to spread out, literature for planning our day. Even though four-tops were available, we were always seated at two-tops which didn't give us room to plan our day.
First breakfast: Hubby had the Waffle with fresh fruit, syrup, a compote and whipped cream. He doesn't like compote or whipped cream; he wants syrup on his Waffle. It's Italian syrup, so way too sweet for his taste. Several days later, I ordered the Waffle and used the compote which I loved as well as a wee bit of whipped cream, which was delicious. In my case, I also ordered bacon, ""crispy, please."" The bacon was prepared ""crispy,"" as I had asked.
First breakfast: I had the Frittata which was topped with dollops of Goat Cheese. It was good. The OJ is $5. I guess that is typical of restaurants but the first breakfast was the first and last time we ordered juice. After that, we swallowed our pills with water. I never have more than a few swallows of coffee, so I brought my own coffee in from the Hotel Lobby. Why pay $5 for half a cup of coffee?
Speaking of water: It is served without asking in all of the Seattle restaurants we visited; and, of course, served without straws. I have a problem with that, because I don't believe that all restaurants get their glasses germ-free; I don't believe the water gets hot enough to sanitize. Just saying.
Second breakfast: My husband wasn't very hungry, so he ordered the Cinnamon Roll. It wasn't warm and the icing had congealed. I had the Waffle and bacon and was very happy.
Third breakfast: We knew we would be out in the wet and rain all day, so we both had Oatmeal. I was surprised it wasn't served with milk. The next day, I ordered Oatmeal again. Different waitress; this one offered milk. We split a Fruit Plate.
Fourth breakfast: By now we were so tired of their limited breakfast menu, we could scream. Fortunately, I rode the elevator with a hotel guest who was carrying two cups of coffee in a tray and a bag of pastries. The next morning, we walked just one block to Vovito where we had tasty, warm Turkey & Cheese Croissant Sandwiches and good coffee. We spent $20 on breakfast at Vovito's instead of $40 at Tulio.
Tulio adds a 5% surcharge to their bills. Hubby didn't notice it when he paid for our first breakfast. I noticed it later. After that, I took care of the bills. I tipped 15% consistently, instead of 20%. In Seattle, check your restaurant bills to see if you're being charged any or all of the gratuity. We dined at two restaurants that add 20% BUT they are clear about it, and say that the wait staff do not expect more. Tulio is sneakier. They make it sound as if it's in accordance with a law to provide a higher minimum wage, but that actually isn't the case at all.
First dinner: We shared the Gnocchi appetizer. The Gnocchis are stuft with Sweet Potatoes and then lightly pan-fried. They were surprisingly good. I had Linguini with Clams. Couldn't see any linguini because there were so many clams. I did eventually get down to the Linguini, at which time I requested cheese. They don't shave the cheese at your table; they spoon already shredded cheese onto your food upon request.
Second dinner: Bartender Leah is great at her job. One evening we just sat at the bar. We wanted some food to soak up the liquor but found their Appetizer Menu to be sorely lacking. When I told Leah there was nothing on it that suited, she offered to put together an antipasto plate. We accepted. We had drinks, the antipasto plate and one slice of Tiramisu. Our bill came to $145!!! Yikes!
Third dinner: My husband had Mussells and thoroughly enjoyed them; the best Mussels he's ever had. I had Pumpkin Soup. It was okay. I've had better. (Five Spice Pumpkin Soup at the historic Panamonte Inn in Boquete, Panamá.)
Dinners are served with Foccacia, but the bread is bland bland bland. We eat Foccacia at home frequently, but what we buy from Trader Joe's is tasty. This was so bland that it was ""one and done.""","Jen Z.","I came here for a business dinner. Tulio it is at a great location as it is right next to the Seattle Public library, the W Seattle, and the Fairmont.
The herb bread was awesome. For drinks, I ordered the lavender Lemon Tini. It was delicious. For food, I ordered the prosciutto wrapped asparagus as an appetizer and orecchiette for entree. The white asparagus and duck egg was an adventure. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The pasta was simple yet comforting. I especially loved the spicy Italian sausage.
Nothing too crazy. Just a good time. Probably not worth a special trip into town. But if you are close by, why not.","Makiah H.","DELICIOUS!!! Another hidden gem within the Kimpton hotel. Except service, amazing food and a great ambiance. Came here for dinner and can't wait to come back! Sat upstairs, they have a great large table for bigger groups and also allows for a little more privacy. Call ahead for reservations as it can get pretty busy. If you're in the mood for great quality Italian food or some great wines this is a must.","Tyger M.","Tulio is my new favorite evening spot, conveniently located 1 block from work and inside the hotel where I typically stay when in Seattle. I'm normally on the verge of being vegetarian, so i love the gnocchi and the risotto, but adore the agnolotti.
Service here is splendid. Sit at the bar if you're here solo. A great experience with company or on your own.","Claudia C.","An amazing little corner place that I really recommend stopping in. I loved how knowledgeable the staff were so when I asked about how things were made and if I could get something without dairy they already knew how things were made and what I could eat.
I got the chicken on a lemon risotto and it was so amazing. It was a perfect balance of lemon with the chicken and who knew risotto could be made without dairy.
The bf got a leg of lamb or something and that was so tender if was falling off the bone.","Lisa P.","We stayed at Kimpton for a few nights before deciding to eat at Tulio. We realized the hotel had given us a $25 discount on a meal there and we were just too tired to go out anywhere else. What a pleasant surprise! The place was cozy and felt very intimate. The service was outstanding and so friendly. The unexpected star for our trip and standout meal. I started with the sweet potato gnocchi, amazing. For dinner I had the roasted chicken with lemon risotto, very good but a tad salty. Still the chicken was cooked perfect. My husband had the ribeye, which he really enjoyed. He also had the local flight of whiskey. He enjoyed that as well.
If I could have, I would give 4.5 stars. Pretty close to perfection had my dinner not been on the salty side....and I even like and usually add salt to my dishes, so if I think it's salty, it's pretty salty.","Josef K.","I could not be more disappointed with Tulio. It's been years since I was last in here, but lunch today was so poor I may not return. The restaurant was probably 40% full and despite that we waited an unreal amount of time for some prosciutto wrapped asparagus (that takes maybe 8 minutes to make) and salads of cold chicken and avocado. Had the chicken been warm I could have imagined a little more time may have been needed. I could have made that entire meal in 12-15 minutes MAX by myself. We waited probably 30-40 minutes. And it wasn't even that good. Inexcusable. You're better than this Tulio.","Tammy Y.","We had a pre-show dinner here in the bistro section (front part of the restaurant by the windows) and were not disappointed! I had bookmarked this place ages ago and finally made it in. They have a large menu of beverages to start off the meal, including a long list of various grappas.
I enjoyed the mixed greens with gorgonzola and the mussels before sharing the butternut squash soup (delicioso!) and linguini and clams. The linguini was a little too al dente for my taste as I couldn't get the noodles to stay wrapped around my fork but the sauce was flavorful and delicious. I will have to return for the pumpkin gelato in the future as I was out of room and needing to head to the theatre at the end of the meal. Looking forward to it! Service was wonderful!","Will H.","Decided to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary here with friends yesterday due to good reviews and proximity to our hotel (the Fairmont Olympic around the corner). Based on our experience I wouldn't recommend Tulio for anyone celebrating a special occasion. Our server ignored the table for most of the evening and was extremely inattentive. The bill included a $39 charge for several glasses of the ""complimentary"" prosecco that was brought to the table when we arrived. After pointing this out it was removed from the bill but it just one of several oversights by the server, including a fly in my spouse's coffee to end the evening. The food was fine but I felt like they could have cared less about our table or the occasion. I would strongly discourage anyone from spending your special occasion here.","Shreya K.","Came here for my parents anniversary dinner and were not super impressed. I picked this place for the great reviews but sadly the food was just average. I honestly would've given 3 stars as the ambience was nice but the waiter tacked on a $62 bottle of wine that we didn't even order. While this could've been an honest mistake it really felt intentional from his behavior and lack of surprise or apology when I pointed it out. Really sketchy/rude if you ask me. The chicken and risotto were both good, but the veggie pizza had no flavor at all. If you're looking for a good Italian restaurant there are tons of better options--The Pink Door being my favorite."
"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Arielle F.","I want to eat my last meal at San Fermo and I want it to be their bolognese. Seriously, this place is amazing whether you are going on a date, entertaining out of towners, or just in the mood for a delicious meal.
A few tips:
1. Always start with the bread and salted butter.
2. Order the burrata.
3. Order the bolognese.
4. Eat EVERYTHING! (This goes without saying.)
If the patio is open I highly recommend sitting outside - it's magical with fairy lights strung all around and there are heaters and blankets if you get chilly. However, they also have multiple beautiful spaces inside so there's really no bad seat in the house.
My SINGLE criticism is I've tried a few of their desserts - most recently the goat cheese cheesecake and a panna cotta drizzled with olive oil - and I haven't been especially impressed. To be honest I don't usually make it to dessert here anyway so it hasn't been a huge issue for me but if you have a sweet tooth I would recommend checking going elsewhere (Ballard is FILLED with great dessert spots, I recommend Hot Cakes).","Katha S.","Best food in all of Seattle. BANGING! Never disappoints.
Have ordered both pasta and meat, has never been disappointment.","Klarke C.","This review is based around my experience for Seattle Restaurant week.
We had a reservation at 7pm and were seated promptly at near the front of the restaurant. San Fermo is located in a small White House in Ballard Ave and has a very cozy feeling! Although we were there for restaurant week, we couldn't resist ordering the charcuterie board and the buratta. Both are must orders if you're visiting. From restaurant week, I had the ceasar salad, spaghetti bolognese and the panna cotta! The bolognese was phenomenal and seems to be an overall favorite. It's also on the regular menu almost daily.
Besides the wonderful food, the service was a highlight. Our waitress was just not knowledgeable about the food but gave wonderful recommendations for wine. Try to Cupertino if you ever visit!
I will for sure be visiting in the future","Karen F.","Decided to give San Fermo another try because the pasta. God damn! I'm so glad we did. This time we had a reservation at 9:30 pm made on opentable but when we arrived the sign out front of the restaurant said that it was closed. We ventured forth and went in and the hostess hadn't realized we were on the reservation list I guess, but she agreed to seat us and said that it wasn't a problem. Our server was very friendly this time. He never once seemed rushed and we were able to enjoy our meal and a lovely bottle of wine without feeling like we were an inconvenience to the staff. The pasta's were incredible again. The pasta with short rib and blue cheese was ultra indulgent. This time the chefs even gave us a complimentary dessert before we left, some sort of mousse that was delicious. What a change the service made to our experience this visit. Would return again 100%","Sean G.","Unreal FRESH and HOMEMADE pastas! This place was amazing and I will definitely be back and recommend to friends! We had the following and they were amazing!
Saffron Spaghetti Bolognese - pork, veal, rosemary, fennel, parmigiano reggiano
Unreal flavor from the first bite to the last!
Agnolotti del Plin - prosciutto cotto and goat cheese filling, nutmeg, culatta
These flavor-packed pillows were my favorite! Amazing flavor and texture
Short Ribs - saffron polenta, cinnamon, cloves, fried leeks, Demi glacé
The meat fell off of the bone and the polenta was a perfect match!
Bruschetta - smoked rockfish, squid ink aioli, pickled peppers, lemon oil
The smoked rockfish was SO FRESH and had wonderful flavors!
House Caesar - anchovy, parmigiano reggiano, red wine croutons
Smothered with fresh cheese and the anchovies had a nice salty taste!","Michael C.","While walking around Ballard and considering dinner options, my friend Joe and I walked past this cute Italian restaurant and checked out the menu. The top item on the Primi & Secondi menu caught both our eyes and we had to get some.
Built onto what used to be a house, there is the intimate front room, a gorgeous patio, and a deep back room as well. I feel all have their pros and cons, so if an option take the back patio, but sitting in the front room and seeing the open kitchen is also a treat.
The menu is robust enough so that anyone could find something, while not being so overwhelming.
From the Antipasti my friend and I decided to split the House Caesar. Really tasty! I really appreciated the whole anchovies that really added to the experience and made you know this place was legit.
While the crab risotto and grilled pork belly did catch my eye, we both got our own Saffron Spaghetti Bolognese. I love saffron, I haven't had good spaghetti in a while, and the mix of pork and veal really called to me. What we got was this beautiful plate of spaghetti covered in sauce and then with a wonderful layer of white cheese. It was very flavorful, and while the bowl isn't huge, the amount of food is deceptively filling. My friend Joe even had some he took for lunch the next day.
All in all a great experience from the staff to the ambiance to the meal itself. I would gladly come back whether with friends, on a date, or even on my own.","Mike V.","The black negroni with black walnut is incredible. And peak autumn/halloween with the orange nasturtium. Can't wait to try the white aromatic sage negroni. The pair would be (tragically) Instagram heaven I'm sure.
They should give lessons in how to compose a ceasar salad. Bravo. And on a cooler blustery autumn day, throughout enjoyed the turmeric mushroom pasta at brunch.
Great service to boot.
Only knock, somewhat limited brunch menu!
For dinner, make reservations, or wait an hour. Simple as that.","Julie A.","The one star is for the ambiance. It's a cute space in a great location.
The food was fine, not amazing, not terrible - unremarkable and overpriced. I don't mind paying $$$ for really good food but this was just not it.
The service was sub-par - maybe because our server was new (she wasn't knowledgeable about the menu) or maybe because they charge an automatic 20% service fee so there's no incentive to provide great service - the tip is guaranteed.
The worst part? The hostess, Meredith. From the first unwelcoming interaction when we arrived, to the last when we were leaving, she stands out as the low point of this entire mediocre experience. Meredith was so incapable of handling a ""stressful"" situation of people backing up in the waiting area that she lost all grace and was completely rude to her guests . Just a reminder to Meredith - you're not saving lives, you're seating people at tables. Get it together.
With so many other great options in the area, don't waste your time and money here.","Shanna L.","First time here. 2.5 stars but rounding down for the reasons noted below.
San Fermo is situated in an incredibly charming house turned restaurant. The interior decor is warm, both in terms of vibe and temperature. We thankfully were able to sit outside for our meal because it was uncomfortable inside -- and the patio was lovely.
The food here is pretty good - but not sensational, and painfully overpriced for what it is.
We ordered 1 appetizer, 1 salad, and 2 entrees (the cheaper of the available options) -- and no drinks -- and spent approximately $100 out the door. That should raise your eyebrows.
Portions are astoundingly small in relation to the price. San Fermo seems to want to go toe-to-toe with the worst aspects of dining in Manhattan, despite being situated in Ballard. That said, I've had way more satisfying Italian meals in Manhattan at this price point...
$14 for one piece of burrata. Menu description suggests it is accompanied by a wondrous array of vegetables and flavors, conjuring images of a satisfying spread. It wasn't much more than thoughtfully assembled, surely with culinary forceps. Didn't even come with a small piece of crostini, literally. See picture.
$14 (I think) for a nectarine salad. Nectarine *wedges* were huge, and were barely dressed or accompanied by the other items listed that we looked forward to (basil, endive, mozzarella - for example) and so tasted more like a fruit plate than anything else.
Now for the entrees: got the Bolognese (which the waitress touted as the restaurant's most popular dish) and a squid pasta dish (I'm forgetting the exact name). The flavor profile of the Bolognese was not nearly as sophisticated as I would have hoped given its popularity. It really lacked any underlying element of freshness and was heavy and monotonous. It was also lukewarm at best when finally delivered to our table (see below). That said, the squid pasta was excellent and truly offered a window into what San Fermo can do extraordinarily well.
Again, very small portions in relation to the price. It's not just small plates and small amounts of pasta. San Fermo doesn't even give you the protein item you expect in your pasta in any meaningful way. The particles of pork/veal were indiscernible vis-a-vis the sauce in the Bolognese and were largely indistinguishable. And there were only tiny squid ringlets. The amount of protein in both dishes was laughable, especially at $22-24 each.
I'd say their entrees, relative to other similarly situated Italian restaurants in Seattle, are approximately 25% - 33% higher.
Worst of all, we waited nearly *FORTY-FIVE* minutes between the time we finished our first course and received our pastas. The waitress was unapologetic and made it seem like this was just a reality of their restaurant, attributing it to the size of the kitchen. If that's the case, do not come here hungry. The last thing you should experience in any restaurant is a feeling of palpable hunger.
Everyone around us had already received their food. It felt like they forgot our order and didn't own up to it, which is unfortunate given that it's a relatively small restaurant with a relatively small menu.
The waitress told us that it would be another 10 minutes (ended up being closer to 20) and handed us a what was probably half a sliced baguette as a consolation about 30-35 minutes into the wait, even though we didn't want it earlier when she offered it (that's another $5, by the way). A more genuine gesture in light of the circumstances would have been to offer a primi or a glass of wine on the house. Didn't happen, and clearly management either wasn't involved or wasn't concerned.
There is an automatic service charge on your meal - and the service reflects that. Our waitress did not refill our water even once. We had to flag her down at every turn; she maybe visited our table four times of her own initiative, twice for greeting/taking our order and once for (expeditiously) bringing and returning the bill: the only fast part of the experience - a telltale sign. (Someone else brought our food.)
The most insidious part: San Fermo assesses their service charge BEFORE assessing tax, whereas most restaurants imposing a service charge do so as a separate item in lieu of gratuity. So, you pay tax on your tip, too. And the lackluster service was the cherry on top.
Sadly, we were here for a special occasion. The restaurant knew that in advance based on the reservation and even called my fiancé beforehand -- and they did absolutely nothing to enhance the experience.
We genuinely felt awful leaving the restaurant, despite the fact that it was supposed to be a celebration. We just moved to the neighborhood and were really hoping to love (and frequent) this place. Alas...","Tami G.","Popped in here on a Monday eve with no reservation and a party of three. They were happy to seat us outside on the adorably Romantic
Patio they have and couldn't be more obliged to make sure we were cozy and warm multiple times throughout the evening. The wine selection was wonderful and there were multiple GF options for me and the server was very informed and accommodating. It was a great experience- would eat here again and super glad we popped in.","Wei H.","Having moved from Chicago, I whine a lot about how Seattle has no decent Italian food. Now I can finally say I have found my favorite pasta in Seattle. Friend and I got a glass of wine each, the endive salad, the carbonara, and the bolognese. The endive salad was fresh, crisp, and ideally acidic to work our appetite up. I loved the bite of the carbonara. The bolognese was just perfection in every bite. That meat sauce was complex and smokey and chunky and ahhhhh I don't even know what adjectives to use. If you eat meat, you HAVE to get this.
And yeah, the ambiance is quite cute and romantic, especially in the attic (roomy and airy, don't worry). But I am desperate enough to just go there alone to devour an entire thing of bolognese.","Kay N.","I came here on a Friday night (they do accept reservations). This place is very intimate, cozy and relaxing atmosphere. It seems like they renovated a home into a restaurant. We got a corner table in the attic. Even though, I said the word attic, trust me, it doesn't feel like an attic. I like their light fixtures up there.
Their menu rotate daily with a couple of staple dishes.I ordered one of their staple dish, the spaghetti bolognese. My boyfriend ordered some kind of a seafood stew dish, like a cioppino. For appetizers, we ordered their antipasto board and got their bread and whipped butter dish (which is pretty good). The antipasto board had high quality meats and cheese and we were pretty happy with it.
I really liked my spaghetti dish, they made it really well. It was flavorful and the pasta was the perfect texture. My boyfriend liked his dish as well, but I think he wished he ordered pasta instead. I mean it is an Italian restaurant!
Overall, the service was great, pretty attentive. Great spot for Italian food in an intimate atmosphere.","Mitchell V.","I've always said that I don't love Italian food. This is a personal thing I am dealing with it. I enjoy Italian food but I hardly ever crave it.
That being said, I have to admit I really did love this place. First things first, this place is really quite expensive. The pastas are easily $8-10 more than other places that also offer handmade noodles and sauces. However, the place is super cute (ideal for date night) and each room feels unique. The service is warm, kind and extremely helpful.
I really did love the quality of the pastas and sauce. The bolognese was great. I've had a lot of truly great bolognese and I really enjoyed this one. The dungeness crab bucatini was exquisite. A lot of seafood pastas will overload on garlic or cream to mask the not so fresh seafood but this let the crab shine. It had the right amount of lemon, butter and crushed black pepper to make a perfectly simple yet extremely delicious plate of pasta.
Also, I need to mention the Caesar salad. Wow. I love Caesar salads and I appreciate when they are anchovy forward (it is a fishy dressing, afterall). This was perfectly dressed with a wonderfully salty, fishy, anchovy-y dressing that will leave me thinking about it for some time. One of my favorite Caesar salads in the city, hands down.","Geana N.","Our expectations were a bit higher for this lovely house restaurant with access to the Sunday market fresh vegetables and proteins. We're a bit disappointed in a the dishes we've tried so far.
Specifically the egg sandwich with arugula salad and the pasta dish (and I added a poached egg). The sandwich had more bread than filling and we found that a bit off putting even though the egg was nicely cooked and rich in of itself. The sandwich needed more protein to stand up to the richness of the egg, the thick bread, and the spicy arugula.
I had the pasta dish and while it was a good dish, I was not blown away by it like I thought I would be. It was a tad, bland. I wanted to like the dish much more but it was just ""good enough"".
The drinks were made well. We liked the mimosas and in fact ordered two each because they were really delightful for a sunny Sunday brunch. There is a bar here, and perhaps next time we just stop in for a drink or two.
One cool thing about the menu is that it changes weekly with only a couple items that remain as staples. Perhaps these dishes just weren't for us. We have visited twice now and have walked away wanting. We'll probably give the food one last try and if it's not great, we won't return.","Julia L.","This is a cute and cozy restaurant. The exterior looks like a residential house painted in white. Once you step inside, immediately to the left is the kitchen. And to your right is a small town of seating, and there are more seating further in the ""house"" as well. The staff are friendly, but not overly so - you'll be left alone to enjoy your meal except for drink refills when necessary. I would recommend the burrata - very soft, fresh, light, and well complemented by the sweet & tart flavors of the diced apple plus balsamic vinegar. Additionally, the light and citric acid flavors of the burrata dish goes well with their housemade focaccia bread. I would also recommend the spaghetti bolognese. It's creamier than the typical bolognese sauce with savory and hearty pork + veal in each bite. For dessert, I tried their tiramisu. It's quite uniquely flavored with pumpkin mascarpone and cinnamon - personally, I wasn't a big fan of the dense texture of the mascarpone as the bottom layer of the tiramisu or the cinnamon mixed with cocoa powder flavor. Nevertheless, I had a lovely dinner experience.","Monya M.","Wow. I've always wanted to go to this restaurant. I won't be back. I came for a 5 pm reservation with 2 friends. We had a nice enough dinner. The food was good. Enough. But not over the top. When we stated that we were hungry but not starving we ended up with way more food than we indicated we wanted to the waitress. But all that aside - we had a lovely ambience. Until this extremely intense woman showed up out of the blue - whom we hadn't seen prior - and aggressively told us that we needed to move immediately as they had a reservation coming up and she stomped away. This was after we were at our table for a little over 2 hours. We were deep in conversation and were taken completely off guard. It was a harsh and abrupt ending and unexpected. We won't be back.","Nicole H.","Pappardelle

This place definitely has that rustic Italian vibe. Its charms blend in perfectly with the historical Ballard feels. Great place for a date night or brunch date. The homemade pasta was fresh. The combination of wagu beef and bone marrow really intensify the beefy flavor. It was a interesting fusion. Keep in mind that the pasta is in Italian portion not American.","Marina K.","Had a great girls night dinner date here on a Friday evening. We got a reservation- I would def recommend it. We were sat upstairs in the attic which was super cute. I could see it getting pretty hot up there but there was AC units so we were good. I have been there 2 other times and didn't even know there was an upstairs. I've sat inside and on the deck which are both great areas as well. Our waiter Zak was the best! So nice and really took care of us. He Recommended the best stuff and everything was delish with our 2 glasses of rose. See photos for all the great things we got. Very good Italian dinner spot and I will def be back.","Kristin H.","I'm updating to five stars. I love this place.
The decor in the cute little house is perfect. I love sitting on the patio. I love the pastas, but when I'm not that hungry, I love the appetizers too.
Perfect place to come eat in the summer (or during the rest of the year, really). One of my favorite restaurants in Ballard.","Tingting W.","I checked this place out when I was walking around the Ballard farmers market. The outside of the restaurant was what pulled me in. It looks like a tiny house (super cute). I sat outside and it was all very hip. The food took a long time but it was worth it. The egg Benedict and the carbonara both tasted FRESH! With a first bite, you know it was not from a can. Everything was so amazing and I would love to come for dinner one night!"
"La Vita E Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-vita-e-bella-seattle-7?osq=Italian+Food","Piko L.","""I'm so full but I must keep eating"" is the motto you leave with after dining here!
Everything here is delicious-- from their bruschetta to their seafood pastas, their pizzas and calzones, nothing disappoints. It's ALL good!
The place is great for dates or groups, and the cute orange walls really set the mood.
I can't wait to come back in the daytime for outside seating so I can get a good photo of this delicious pasta!","Valerie S.","Delicious Italian food!
We ordered takeout since we wanted to eat at the comfort of our own place that was just beside the restaurant as I read that service could be better. I looooooove carbonara pasta and was stoked to see it on the menu w their homemade spaghetti. It had just the right touch of cream, bacon, and cheese. Mmm! Although I was eyeing the pesto penne, we went with the spaghetti de mare because my mom wanted something w seafood. That was light and scrumptious as well. If you're looking for a pasta wo cheese, that's a great choice! The mixed salad is as normal as any salad w oil and vinegar. Their tiramisu was so creamy and not too sweet. It was the icing on top of an already totally above our expectations meal. If you're in the area, stop by for some homemade pasta. Your tastebuds and stomach will thank you!","Alex C.","Ordered the pepperoni pizza, spaghetti carbonara, and ceasar salad for delivery.
The restaurant forgot our salad and delivered a mushroom pizza. Not sure what's happening behind the scenes at this spot.
They get a star because the spaghetti carbonara was on point, but otherwise the didn't leave an impression worth exploring again. Won't be back.","Nancy S.","The food and service here is just amazing!!! Came here with a friend on the recommendation of another good friend and I have no regrets!
I ordered their seafood spaghetti and was not disappointed- it had sooooooooooo much delish seafood on it!!! The portioning is very generous and the quality exceptional... can't wait to come here again!!!","Fraser C.","I have been dining here a few times a year for over 10 years. The food is AMAZING and the service is great. Some of the best pasta in town!
The quality of food is very high and prices are reasonable.","Francesco L.","I've been coming here for about a year and a half now and this place never disappoints. Great hours and great food. If your looking for some great Italian food in Downtown Seattle this place is a must","Lana P.","Super disappointing. Deserving good reviews brought us here for dinner.
Service sucks and don't mind little fruit flies all over your food. Food was very so so and I could not get out there fast enough to get away from those flies and dirty walls.","Abhinav S.","Had a crave for Italian food, and wanted to try out a new place. So this brought me to La Vita.
Ambiance:
It has a nice dim-lit casual atmosphere. Lunch and dinner is good here.
Service:
Service is alright. They don't do anything out of their way, or even try to be friendly. You're just a paying customer to them, that's about it.
Food:
I'm docking off a star because their bread... how do I put it mildly... is pretty bad, it's store bought! I mean it's literally the same as the $2 Trader Joe's bread that I buy. Even the cheapest Italian places have better bread. The garlic oil is decent.
Onto the main course, now this is where they shine. I had the Pesto Penne, and the pesto was super fresh, and just about everything about their main dishes, including the white sauce pasta is good!
Price and Portion:
Portions are hearty, no complaints there. Infact, mind you, the food is like super rich. Your heart will give out if you eat too much. Price is perfect too.
All in all, if you're willing to forgive their dismal excuse of a bread and look past that, everything else is great!","Sharon C.","Came here to celebrate my friends' birthdays! There's plenty of street parking. Pretty good prices for pasta here. It was kind of cold, so we were planning to say we wanted to sit inside when the server asked us whether we would want to sit inside or outside. But he never asked...LOL he just seated us outside. I'm sure we could have told him we wanted to be seated inside instead, but we just didn't say anything.
Service was alright otherwise. The waiters were pretty nice.
Free bread! It's not as good as the bread at the Cheesecake Factory, but it was alright.
The presentation of all the pasta dishes we got was very nice! The portions are good for the price too. We had leftovers that we took home.
I got the fettucine tartufo ($18) which has Italian sausage, truffle oil, Italian sausage, and cream sauce. It's definitely on the heavy side, but I liked it. I would give it a 4/5. It's super oily though. Kind of felt like I was eating oil.
We also got the spaghetti di mare ($19), and we were impressed with how much seafood it came with. It comes with tiger prawns, mussels and clams, and they were really generous with the amount. And the price wasn't bad at all for a seafood pasta. The garlic flavor wasn't too strong, and this dish wasn't as heavy as the fettucine. This would probably get a 4.5/5!
The spaghetti carbonara ($15) was so good! Also a 4.5/5. But I really love carbonara. It comes with pancetta, and the spaghetti is so creamyyy. I would probably get this one if I went again.","Stephanie L.","I had the cannelloni. You read that correctly- that is not cannoli! Think enchiladas but Italian! The big noodles were smothered in bolognese and cheese. Every bite was heaven. The portion is great if you're really hungry. Otherwise lucky you, leftovers for lunch! This is one of the most amazing Italian dishes I've ever had. The atmosphere here is lively as well. I can't wait to go back. I'll try to get something different but something tells me I'll be getting the cannelloni again :).","Crystal F.","We ordered takeout through GrubHub from this restaurant. The carbonara we received was clearly mad with whole eggs--there were chunks of gross undercooked egg whites throughout. We immediately contacted GrubHub who contacted the restaurant. The restaurant's response was ""we cannot guarantee the quality of the food"" and they refused to refund us for the inedible dish. Food wasn't good and customer service was worse.","Janelle M.","Amazing customer service and delicious food! Stopped after driving by deciding Italian sounded good for lunch and we were blown away. Some of the best food we have had! Our family will definitely be back!","Kayla K.","I'll start off by saying that the food was good.
However, everything else was not good. I asked the server his preference between two pasta dishes. He suggested one over the other, so I ordered that. Our salad came out quickly, and then the entrees took forever. We were all very hungry by the time our entrees arrived, about 30+ minutes later. The entree given to me was not what I had ordered. It wasn't even the other pasta dish I had asked about. I told the waiter this and he begrudgingly took the entree away. It was not what I had ordered, why is that my fault? I thought that they would hurry to make the correct entree, but I was wrong. My family finished their meals and then my food was given to me. At this point, I had waited an hour total for my entree. I asked the server for pepper flakes, he never came back with them. I had to ask two more times before they were brought to me.
Then, the receipt came. We were charged for the incorrect entree that they had initially brought out to me. The server seemed extremely annoyed that he had to fix the receipt. They not only tried to charge us more than we should have paid, but did not apologize once, or comp anything for the inconvenience. Not even my $3 soft drink.
A sorry would have gone a long way in this situation, but it never came. The whole time I felt like I was the one at fault. We will not be returning to La Vita E Bella.","Joan S.","I went on an excursion today with my dog and walk down second Avenue just to see what was down there and I went to this restaurant the food was amazing they allowed me to bring my dog in and sit at a table I had the biggest Caesar salad I've ever had in my whole life and the lasagna was enough for two people extremely fresh and they gave me garlic bread and a whole meal was $24. Really?
The atmosphere was very upbeat pleasant nice to look at maybe it was because of the weather outside but I would definitely take my friends there. if you go order the lasagna and they might even give you some garlic bread and bring your dog but you'll probably have to sit outside I was allowed to sit inside .this place ranks 5 stars restaurant,
You might also meet Giuseppe Forte the owner
Another fantastic meal at the restaurant today
Pasta dish with chicken sausage
Service amazing
Great experience
Lunch time today on a nice day !!!
All staff generally friendly go have lunch!","Maddie E.","We discovered this place on Postmates and keep coming back for more. If you're looking for pasta, the carbonara is a MUST get. It's incredible. Their bread and salads are mediocre but I strictly come here for carbonara.","Mary M.","Christmas Dinner was fantastic here! We got the tortellini and linguini. The noodles were fresh and delicious! We also had the sparkling wine and the olive bruschetta! They had forgotten about the bruschetta and quickly made it right by comping it! Would go back again and again! Definitely use Open Table and book ahead of time! We also tried the cannoli which was fantastic!","Douglas W.","Amazing service. They weren't super busy but seemed to be under staffed. Our waiter was juggling multiple tables but knew how to handle it. When he felt he wasn't visiting us fast or often enough he'd do a drive by and update us on where we stood. That small gesture makes the difference. My wife and I just took the time to have a great conversation about our vacation in Seattle.
Once the food arrive it was nothing short of AMAZING!","JC J.","Service was great
Food was very tasty
Ambiance: terrible, my eyes are really bad, and the place is just too damn dark, I cant read the menu. Had to open my cell phone flashlight to read the menu. The pizza was good, but the sausage could have been more.. it was just sprinkled with a few shredded sausages... was just in the center of the pie.
Overall was good. I'd come again, but next time I will try to request to sit outside patio. 3 stars for now, I'll change my rating next time I come back.","Edward S.","La Vita E Bella is a nice Italian restaurant in the heart of Belltown. It has a really old school feel to it. In English, the name translates to Life and Beautiful, which is a good name.
The reviews were kind of mixed, but I guess I came on a good night. The wine list was good--I ordered some nice red. For the appetizer I had the Caprese salad--it was really good with nice, fresh tomatoes.
For the main course I had a cheese pizza. I thought it was really good. The crust was nice and thin and I loved the tomato sauce.
I will definitely be back","Victoria T.","Wonderful Italian restaurant in Belltown. In town for biz and dining alone but treated wonderfully. Chianti excellent, house salad had beautiful tomatoes on it and pasta fettuccine tartufo (spettacolare!) enjoy this dining experience if you can. Beautiful dinner."
"Cinque Terre Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cinque-terre-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer T.","Have been here several times for team lunches/HH and I am always soooo impressed by the quality+ presentation of food, friendly service, and open/bright ambiance. Also love that they provide complimentary sparkling spring water and fresh focccacia bread (sooo freaking good, and did i mention it's complimentary???).
Most recently, booked this place for a team lunch and everyone really enjoyed their meals (including the vegetarians!). They have something on the menu to satisfy any type of craving/dietary restrictions -- from housemade pastas/pizzas to a variety of seafoods and steaks.
I ordered their seafood salad which was loaded with fresh prawns, octopus, squid, and clams. Very generous portions and fresh flavors!
Yes, the prices here are a bit steeper than your typical lunch fare in SLU, but totally worth IMO. Also great for larger group gatherings as they have a table in the back that fits 10+ people.","Jared M.","Great spot in SLU for some Italian food.
I came here for lunch and got one of their specials which was a pizza with mushrooms, buffala and mozzarella. I loved the pizza and there was plenty to save some for leftovers.
Will definitely come back here for a dinner or another lunch soon!","Shantanu G.","We had a large-ish family dinner here.
Positives - polite and efficient waitstaff, attentive service. Very good wine list, the wine expert in our group managed to pick two really good wines at a reasonable price point ($40). A couple of the dishes were really good - the cuttlefish and the octopus items
Rest of the dishes were mediocre given the price point of the restaurant. These were more fitting of a mass market Italian restaurant.","Dave F.","Great happy hour spot. The bartenders and service are excellent. I loved the calamari, octopus and oysters. Nice wine selection.
I look forward to the next visit.","Alexis M.","Came here for my 21st birthday dinner. We had a party of 8. We sat at the ""Table 8,"" the semi private table in the corner of the dining room. The ambience was great. Definitely felt like we were in a private room. The food was amazing of course. The lobster was my favorite, it tasted so fresh. They also let us bring our own cake which was nice!! Definitely recommend for a private event!","Sophie S.","Beautiful restaurant with great service and delicious food. We came here for my friend's 21st birthday and they let her keep a cake that she brought from home in the back while we ate. Our waitress was sweet and helpful when it came to recommending food and drinks. The focaccia bread that came with our food was incredible. Best I have ever had. I ordered the squid ink spaghetti with seafood and it was delicious! There were so many dishes on the menu that I wanted to try, so I will be returning to dine here again soon.","Tanusree M.","Super cute place for happy hour! Came here after work with a few coworkers. The happy hour menu is great. We got $10 bottle of rose! Amazing. We ordered a lot of food too, we got the cheese board, charcuterie, Margherita pizza, gnocchi, octopus and 2 bottles of wine. We spent quite a lot of time here and really enjoyed ourselves. The waitress was super nice and attentive. This place is perfect for a night out with the girls. Highly recommend!","MyAnne K.","Great restaurant. Great food. Great ambiance. Cannot believe I have not dined here before till recently. Was able to reserve a table 30 mins before leaving my house to walk over on a Saturday night. This restaurant offers a full range of options across the board from vegetarian/seafood/poultry/meat in all categories appetizers/pasta/secondi/carne. There is something for everyone. We ordered the octopus/buratta/Chilean sea bass/seafood stew. My goodness! Seafood stew was some of the best I've ever had served with a split lobster tail. Every bite was delicious. We also learned this restaurant is sister to Barolo/List/Mama Melina's. Dammmn! I love Italians!","Christina C.","Place is really packed during happy hour. Last time we came it was full and they didn't even offer us to wait so we had to go somewhere else. The next time we got lucky and had a small table. Pizza is really yummy, steak need more sauce, oysters were excellent. I really like the place but you never know if you will get a seat.","Jonathan L.","We came here during lunch rush on Thursday. We were immediately seated since we had a reservation and got served bread on the table right away. The waitress was respectful about us needing to be in a rush due to lunch break. I ordered the Funghi Di Stagione pizza which was served in a timely manner. The mushrooms on the pizza were sufficient; however I thought it needed to be seasoned more since it was lacking in flavour. Also the dough was a bit on the burnt side which overpowered all of the toppings on the pizza but the cheese was very fragrant. Overall I recommend this place for Italian food but could be better with these suggestions!","Maya D.","I will preface my review by saying I do not like salad! Today I had the perfect salad with fresh baby greens, radicchio, and buttery Gorgonzola cheese, accented by fresh olive oil and fresh lemon. Can I say that I am truly a fan of simple food combinations.
Tonight eggplant Parmesan was the special. The chef prepared a plate of thinly sliced eggplant layered with mozzarella and fresh basil. Heavenly is the best way to describe my meal.
Topped it off with tiramisu (lady fingers soaked in coffee and amaretto). Probably the best I have ever tasted. It was not too sweet and just the perfect portion.
It was my birthday so it was served with a sparkling firework.
This is a great place for date night.","Xinran A.","Went there with my dad just to try their famous seafood soup and was not disappointed! They will split the soup for you if they know you are sharing, which is nice and convenient.
Each soup has a variety of seafood and the amount is decent for 20ish bucks/person. I really like the bread they put into the soup as not every restaurant does that and I particularly like the texture of bread after it was soaked in the soup and absorbed all the juice. They also gave you free baguette so you can dip the bread in the soup even more. However the soup does get cold pretty quickly and that can affect its taste and the dining experience.
We didn't order anything else and I was satisfied after eating. I think one appetizer + the soup will definitely make two people full, or just the soup itself might also be fine depending on your appetite.
The environment is modern and the service is on point. I would say this restaurant is good for either casual dining or for special days like anniversary/birthday etc.","Ronda N.","Italian done the right way! I ate here for lunch and was blown away by everything. The restaurant's decor is open, airy modern. It is bright and refreshing just like many restaurants in Italy.
The menu offers a wide range of meats, pastas, pizzas, etc.. The wine list is extensive with many that compliment the food.
My family and I shared a fettuccine alfredo appetizer to start. It was AMAZING!!! We then had minestrone soup, mix green salad before our spaghetti and veal meatballs. It was a guilt free meal made from the best ingredients.
The host and server were excellent. We had nice seating choices and our meals were timed perfectly.","Duyen T.","Perhaps I'm just not the target clientele for this place and that's quite alright! Definitely get the vibe that this place is pretending to be fancier than it actually is. I had a lunch here and expected some reasonably priced lunch options, but nope still experienced sticker shock. I had the appetizer size of the pulpo (octopus) and the waitress was very nice in warning me that it really is a snack size of 5 bites, and I appreciated the warning! So I fully knew what I was in for but it was still a bit surprising to see the plate in front of me. It was a dressed up single mini tentacle for $14. My coworker let me try her pesto pasta and it was a wee bit too al dente, almost to the verge of undercooked.
Pros: Delicious complimentary bread and olive oil for dipping.
I'll try coming back for happy hour and see if that changes my mind.","Lexi H.","5 star happy hour, 3-4 star regular hours.
Cinque Terre (and neighboring Barolo) are home to some of the best happy hours in Seattle. 50% off bar food and select bottles of wine (red, white or rose) for $20... (and a bottle of Veuve Clicquot for $48 is a steal) you really can't beat that for quality Italian food and fresh seafood. The happy hour is such a great deal, but I find regular prices a little spendy for the portion size (although I suppose you could argue the quality makes up for it).
The complimentary bread is seasoned and soft, paired nicely with a chili olive oil of some type. I recommend ordering a multitude of things to split amongst your group; the polpo is one of my favorites (keep in mind the happy hour polp is a very small portion, whilst the polpo Mario entree is larger and over mashed potatoes... YUM!). Happy hour includes a half dozen oysters for $11. For dessert, there are some classic Italian desserts, none of them to be regretted. I'm a sucker for good tiramisu, and theirs is light, fluffy and hits the spot. The food presentation and service is always top notch.
The ambiance is fine, though the decor feels a little too 'trying really hard to be modern and upscale' to me (but this could impress your guests if that is appealing to them) - and there's a small outdoor space you can sit in when the weather is nice. Note that it sits next to the main Amazon HQ campus, so it can be pretty busy for happy hours right after work Monday - Friday. Luckily, they have a late night happy hour that begins at 9 p.m., so if you can hold out until then, it's well worth it!","Sukhman T.","The location was wonderful because it was right by Amazon headquarters. The interior was modern style which had a wooden stove, booth seating, bar seating and great lighting.
The waiter was very nice and ensured we enjoyed our food. He even got to know us better by having a small conversation. I would come back to try something else other then the pizza because was not impressed. The bread here is amazing and would come back for the bread they serve. We got seconds of the bread. They are known for their seafood but would have to ask a friend to try it and let me know since I am vegetarian.","Yao H.","Had dinner here after work. I arrived around 5:30pm and got the liberty to choose a table near the window. Great view and nice vibe. It started with complimentary sparkling water and bread with olive oil, both of which were great. I had fettuccine con gamberi al limone, which contained five huge prawns and various spices. It tasted really creamy and had different layers of tastes. It came in large portion and I could barely finish it. For dessert I chose tiramisu, and thought it was their special. It came with a little firework, which was awesome and made me really happy about it. The tiramisu was nicely presented, with fresh berries dotted on each corner of the plate. It was not bad, it was just average. Overall I enjoyed my time here:)","Kimmy L.","My friends and I were craving Italian, so we went here for Seattle Restaurant Week.
The atmosphere was very modern and pleasant. We also arrived earlier than our reservation, but we were seated right away.
While I was perusing the menu, the waiter gave us complimentary made-in-house focaccia bread. The bread was good, but the olive oil lacked taste.
Since the Seattle restaurant week deal was 3 courses for $35, I ordered:
Appetizer- Spring Salad with dried lemon, cheese and walnuts
Entree- Seafood Cioppinno (Seafood in a tomato broth)
Dessert- Tiramisu.
My friend ordered the same thing as me, and we were both very disappointed by the salad. Even though it came with a dressing, it was extremely bland. I also thought the dried lemon was a strange salad topping.
The seafood cioppinno was the best dish of the three, although it was overly salted. They were generous with the amount and variety of seafood though. It had octopus, fish, clams, mussels and shrimp.
The slices of tiramisu were HUGE. It had a good creamy texture, but it only had slight notes of espresso. It mainly just tasted like whipped cream which was disappointing.
Service and atmosphere were excellent, but I was not wowed by the food here and will not come back.","Kelly S.","This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants to visit. Ambiance is great and service has always been good. Their pasta is cooked al dente and usually on point. Their HH is a good deal and in May/June, they get their mussels from Taylor Shellfish and have the best steamed mussels in Seattle!","Nicole L.","I have now been here a couple of times ~ both times the atmosphere was perfectly poshy (I love to be fu fu every once and a while) and fantastic for socializing over wine and food with friends. Both times- the service was perfectly matched to the atmosphere. The servers were timely and not over bearing, giving suggestions of wine or food when needed, and always ensuring we enjoyed what we were consuming.
And while I enjoyed this restaurant throughly - I only gave it four stars due to the average cost of menu items , and how much I loved each dish. This is no doubt an expensive restaurant. The dishes I tried were good- just not super in love with them:)"
"Intermezzo Carmine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/intermezzo-carmine-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Jordan M.","Exactly the experience I expected from a nice evening out at a nice-looking place such as this.
We were greeted warmly and told to sit wherever we want and we got a nice little table in the corner by the fire outside. The menu was fairly small, especially for food, which I actually love! The options were quite wonderful and I could've ordered nearly anything on the menu.
We opted to start with ""The Dark Heart"" for the cocktail and a glass of wine. Both were excellent. Our appetizer was three little fried risotto and cheese balls that were delicious!
For a main course we got the pasta with Wild Boar Ragu and goat cheese along with the Pesto Risotto topped with New York Steak. $14 and $18 respectively. Great value at such a place like this.
For dessert I got a tiramisu which was exactly what you would expect from a high-end tiramisu so it was nothing impressive or unique but it was very good. I could say the same for the crème brûlée. It was your standard crème brûlée but it had a really really nice taste. Everything here was done very well and the evening was wonderful. The two servers that continually took care of us were wonderful as well.
Not only was it a wonderful experience but it was a pretty good value I think. The bill was less than $100. I'll be back!!","Bernie L.","This place is, in reality, a 4.5. I can't give them a five because they're not unbelievable, but they're still really really good!
We went there before heading to an event and while the food portions are small the price is reasonable enough you can order a few things. I had the Arancini, which they often run out of. They were fantastic. Though I love a good riceball.
Moving on to the next course I had the Fettucine carbonara. Delicious. Small, but great. Same with the cherry duck confit with polenta. Fruity, delicious, wonderfully cooked.
The tiramisu was also great, though other people I was dining with thought it was too strong.
Service is great, though we were there on a slow night. Still, I get the feeling service is always good.
A hidden gem not too far from the stadiums. I will definitely be back.","Cara L.","I can't believe we waited so long to return to Intermezzo Carmine. But we finally made it back and I'm so glad we did!
I didn't go with a cocktail this time because I just wanted a glass of bubbles. But my late night dinner special of spaghetti and meatballs stuffed with mozzarella was delicious. At first glance I thought it was a little light on the portion size. But after eating I was sufficiently satisfied.
We also started with the sausage stuffed olives and they were very good! My only not would be I wished there was a sauce on the side. The olive and sausage combined was so rich that a it needed a tomato sauce or something similar to cut that richness. We still finished them and they were still darn tasty.","Megan R.","Wow, I loved this place! We came in after a Yelp event and it was perfect because they weren't too busy. I have been trying to eat here for like a year! But they are either always packed or we come on Sunday and they are closed on Sunday.
So this was our lucky day! We sat up at the bar and our bartender was wonderful the whole night.
We started with the anti pasta. It was delish. Full of yummy veggies, some meat, cheese and bread. For entrees we ordered shrimp risotto and carbonara. Both entrees were excellent! The shrimp were wrapped beautifully in prosciutto. The carbonara was just as lovely and my fav out of the two dishes but not by much b/c they were both so good!
The ambience in here is beautiful and sexy. It's a great place for a date night or for a more intimate night out with friends.
I love it here b/c it's really reasonably priced, unpretentious service, cool sexy vibes and delicious food. We had such a great night and I can't wait to come back!","Paulina H.","Randomly found this place and saw the lovely design and decorations, it's so beautiful and arrogant. I went around 2:30pm, so it's not busy. I ordered Carbonara, it tasted bland and a little too much black pepper, egg over cooked so I can't make the yolk leaked. However, I do the taste of this dish, so I would still recommend this. The chop salad with steak is also a good choice, steak is medium rare and cooked perfectly. Everything taste perfectly together, especially with avocado! Highly recommend the salad. I will definitely go back and try other things.
Food: 8/10
Service: 9/10 (since it's not busy hours, the servers were mostly talking and didn't really come check on us)
Environment: 10/10","Melody L.","Definitely a cute, intimate place to share a drinks and eat a meal with friends. They don't have a wait list and it's first come, first served. You have to keep an eye out for a table.
Upon entering, I was in awe of its decor and atmosphere. My friends and I didn't order any drinks, but it seems like their drink selection is pretty vast and reasonably priced. We each ordered a pasta, which was on the smaller side in terms of portions. The pastas were cooked perfectly al dente and the noodle to sauce ratio was pretty good. We also ordered an appetizer to share (the risotto balls), which was only okay. The risotto tasted more like thick white rice.
Service was good as well. Great place to check out if you're not too hungry and looking to catch up with friends and/or have an intimate date night!","Erin J.","As my friend said ""this place is so civilized."" I'll call it approachable fancy. It was certainly upscale but not intimidating at all. Gorgeous decor that's cozy yet airy at the same time... I could sit there all day.
We had a bottle of white and the kale Caesar with chicken and the fettuccine carbonara. It was all amazingly delicious and I'll likely find my way back next time I'm in town!","Johnny L.","Intermezzo Carmine
A lot of goat flavor in their arancini when it has parmesan, mozzarella cheeses, wild mushroom filled inside risotto bites.. indeed done perfectly.. but the goat taste overpowers the piece
Chicken Parmesan is very light in flavor.. needs more seasoning (nms)! Bread nicely toasted, great fresh basil n melted cheese.. came w/ a pear salad but I am not here 4 that
Welcoming environment, just needs less goat taste n nms!","Karen Z.","This place had a very charming ambiance, and the service was excellent. I came here on a Tuesday evening and ordered:
- 1/2 a portion of the green grilled salad (5/5): Super fresh, packed with lots of tasty veggies. Great starter!
- Steak tartare (3/5): This was tasty, but the steak was at times difficult to chew.
- Prawn risotto (5/5): Incredible. The prawns were amazing! They were grilled and wrapped in prosciutto -- very tender and perfectly seasoned. The risotto was very well done as well.
Overall, had a great dining experience but the quality of the steak tartare kept it from being five stars -- wish I'd ordered another dish instead!","Nupur M.","Came here for a weekday lunch. Loved the interiors. It wasn't too crowded and we got seating immediately. It did not have many veg options. We ordered the arancini, the fettuccine carbonara without any meat which was good. Loved the poached egg on the top. The arancini was okay did not like it much. Loved the tiramisu. The creme brûlée was good.","Sebastian T.","Upon wanting to explore all the cocktail bars in the Seattle area, Intermezzo Carmine not only offered cocktails but also Italian food. I went with a friend and decided to give it a shot! The space was a bit small, but it had a relaxed upscale vibe. This would be a great spot for ordering just cocktails without food as well. I'd love to come back in the summer as they have a nice outdoor seating area too.
The drinks and the food were at a typical upscale price & portion. I tried a cocktail, the glazed duck confit & the spaghetti Nero.
The cocktails were great, and exactly as i would expect at this price point. No qualms here!
The glazed duck confit as average at best, the cherry glaze didnt seem to compliment the flavor of the duck very well, and parts of the duck was overcooked and dry.
The spaghetti Nero was fantastic, it was an interesting touch to add the smoked salmon, as it was my first time having smoked salmon with the pasta but it strangely complimented the flavors well, the smokiness blended with the tomato & the creaminess seemed to blend right in with the flavors of the pasta.
Overall, it is a bit pricey for what you get, but given that this is finer dining, it was a satisfying experience. I wasn't wow'ed enough to come back again, but i would recommend coming by at least once to check out the space!","Shoa J.","Absolutely horrible experience. I had my birthday here this past weekend and after confirming 3 times over the phone on where we would like to be seated, we didn't get the table we had requested and they put us on a table for 6 when the reservation was for 8 (the server did acknowledge that the reservation clearly called out the specific table we had requested). The way we were now seated, I had one friend just sitting by himself cut off from the rest of us.
Our server was rude and just not mentally present. Our drinks took forever to come, I had to reorder my wine twice since the server was spaced out. They even picked up my pasta before I finished it- by far the worst service I have ever received. All of us agreed that we would never return to this place.","Savannah S.","Love Intermezzo!! Such a solid, cute bar with awesome cocktails and great bartenders!
I've been twice and love it. The pasta is delicious (I mean Carmine's, their formal restaurant is AMAZING) so it's no surprise. The drinks are creative, fun, and use high quality spirits.
The space is beautiful, chic, and one of the many great spots in pioneer square. I love the bartenders- so fun and personable (got free tequila shots last time!)
Highly recommend for a casual meal with good drinks!","Molly M.","This place was one of our favorites on our trip to Seattle! We just stopped in for a cocktail during a walk (but brunch looked good too). We were attracted to the openness of the restaurant. There was plenty of space to have a private meal and tons of natural light. The cocktails were very unique and super tastey. Not too sweet which I always worry about. The bartender was awesome and gave us plenty of recommendations for Seattle and Portland. I wish I got her name because my boyfriend and I sat and talked with her for over an hour and actually enjoyed it. Highly recommend!","Rosa K.","First of all the ambience and the décor of this place is amazing. It is perfect for a girls night or date night- with wine and cheese (you can't go wrong with the antipasti, salumi and the oysters).
One of my favorites is the fettucine carbonara. I've had the lamb chops and the bone marrow which were really good too. These are all really rich, so make sure to order a drink with it!
The dishes are all pretty small so whenever I come here, we order a couple of dishes so we can try a little of each.","Mikall D.","Wow - the atmosphere and service was impeccable. Professional, attentive, and kind staff. Certain food items were delicious , others were just okay..which is the reason for a deduction of 1 star. I will likely go back and try some different items .","Amanda C.","Was quite disappointed with this place. FYI I came for food and not drinks, so can't comment on their cocktails. I thought the squid ink pasta was very average, the pasta was cooked longer than al dente, and the portions were small. Flavors were there though. The arancini that my friends and I shared was also just okay. The risotto inside was really bland, and I could not really taste the mushrooms.","Rian F.","Great food, smaller selection than their parent restaurant. Had dessert and drinks. The creme brûlée was awesome! My wife liked the tiramisu as well. Only thing is that the place is a little loud.","Irina B.","A really underwhelming experience here given the excellent reviews. The food was bland and nothing special, and the service didn't help either. The arincini was really disappointing - it didn't have a crispy crust and tasted like plain rice, no flavor or seasoning whatsoever. I also had the grilled veggie salad which tasted fine but it wasn't anything special. My friend had the bucatini, which apparently was good but not great. Portion sizes are on the small side but I think the prices reflect that. Prices are pretty low for the location and ambience (the decor was nice) but you can get way better tasting food for the same price elsewhere.
Our server was dismissive and cold from the moment we walked in to when we left, which didn't help the mediocre food. Would not come back.","Bo P.","Keep in mind this isn't a general rating, but a subjective one based on my experience and dish alone :)
I've been to Intermezzo a handful of times for happy hour, but this was a different experience. Our waiter was incredible. Friendly, attentive, but gave us our time/space to catch up with the friends that we were with. We were waiting for the birthday girl to show up, and he was genuinely patient as he continued to bring out plates of bread to keep us preoccupied.
The fettucini carbonara was honestly perfection to me. The noodles were al dente, there was just the right amount of pancetta, and the poached egg's consistency was just as I wanted.
The waiter (I wish I got his name!) comped a tiramisu on behalf of the birthday girl, and while we told him it was OK, he insisted, and we obliged. And we were so happy that we did. They say it's a delicious 100-year old recipe and it tastes exactly like that. Best tiramisu I've had to date."
"G.H. Pasta Co.","https://www.yelp.com/biz/g-h-pasta-co-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tanya A.","Went here in the summer, dragging my bougie reluctant sister who was looking to go to a nice sit down for lunch. I hadn't actually been to GH Pasta Co before, and I didn't know it was fast casual, but we were in a rush anyway, so I pushed that we try it out. My sister quickly shut up once the fork of pasta was in her mouth. The food spoke for itself. Didn't need to be anything fancy, sit down, or Michelin-rated...the pasta was so dang good it was in a category of its own; let's call this category ""Ain't 't Gotta Be Fancy To Win Mouths.""
Seriously, get anything off the menu, it's all delicious. Even the salads are awesome, if you're not a salad person.
Highly recommend. Not sure if Grassa is owned by SA aw company, but both are similar. Grassa is in PDX.","Yegee L.","This restaurant is like a pasta factory, churning out fresh made to order pastas. It is a very small place so it's often hard to dine in and the line sometimes goes out the door. During peak lunch time around 12, it takes quite a while to get your order but the line dies down at 1.
The pasta is always very fresh, especially the tomato sauce options. The noodles are usually cooked al dente. They don't have a lot of options with protein but the two they have (spaghetti bolognese or gemelli w/chicken) comes with a good serving of their respective proteins. All of their pastas come with fresh grated Parmesan as well.
The truffle tonnarelli and the gemelli w/ chicken are quite rich & heavy. Even though I personally like the truffle tonnarelli the best, I do get tired of the strong flavor it has. If you're looking for a lighter more fresh option I would go with one of the two tomato sauce options spaghetti bolognese and the tomato rigatoni w burrata.","Tazeen L.","Lunch spot with fresh pasta with interesting flavor profiles. This time around had the shrimp & chili bucatini which was tossed in a spicy, creamy sauce. Pasta was al dente and a pretty good portion, only part I didn't care for was the shrimp size which was similar to small salad style shrimp.
Place is pretty small with about a dozen seats, usually take it to go for al fresco dining. Worth checking out for a midday carb fix...","Kamara S.","The first time I came here, I was told that the worst day to come is Friday due to availability of ingredients. What days I come to this place... Fridays (yes I am a glutton for punishment).
As of fan of the sister restaurants (Le Messe, Haymaker, Raccolto, and others from General Harvest restaurants) I definitely wanted to try this one as it is for lunch and the prices for the pasta are relatively cheap.
This is definitely not a sit down place and while it has some seats, it is definitely a fast casual restaurant to probably buy food and take it to go. The place is definitely small that during the main lunch work hour it would definitely be packed.
There is a relatively small menu available but the options are good ones and the times I have been there, I see an additional special. Again, sometimes some options are unavailable due to availability (late Friday,
Prawns) but there are enough options to find something you would like plus one time they replaced a missing ingredient with something else and it went well.
It's a great way to get bucatini with clams or just tonnarelli with truffle and parm. Plus fried oysters or kale salad for appetizers (and relatively cheap). Plus, I am not mad at the portions. I could save half/a quarter after a meal if I want (but I am a champ)! Plus, they don't skimp on the cheese.
Overall, it is great for what it is. If there is space, you can sit down with a Pellegrino (blood orange) or a white claw (nothing too alcoholic because you may have to go back to work) and enjoy good pasta. Plus you get a map of the other restaurants in the company (not all of them are on there though).","Sachi E.","Good pasta spot near SLU. The lines get pretty long at peak times and the pasta takes some time to prepare. The pasta itself was pretty salty, but still good. They only list the main 3 ingredients in each pasta and exclude the fact there are onions and other bell peppers / veggies they throw in. I myself would have liked to have known that they include other ingredients for allergy info. That said, the pasta is good only if you like VERY AL DENTE NOODLES. if you don't, I wouldn't recommend.","Tani S.","We have been here twice and have been impressed both times. I love heading to il Corvo but with my husband's office across town no chance for time for a lunch date with him.
The service is extremely sweet and I love the variety of the menu! I honestly don't know how they are able to cook so many interesting pastas.
Today we had the special of the day with tonarelli, rigatoni alla Bolognese (they were sweetly able to do this with rigatoni as opposed to spaghetti and removed chili pepper for my elementary school son), and bucatini with chili. All three were delicious--my favorite was the Bolognese. I could have this weekly and not get bored of it. The pasta was cooked to perfection.
This is fast becoming a new favorite the only drawback is I wish they had more comfortable seating especially for the price point :(. We lucked out and were able to get counter seats but have skipped out eating a couple of times when the restaurant has been overflowing.","Ariella P.","Walking around Seattle can really work up an appetite! We dropped into GH Pasta Company based on Yelp reviews, looking for a fast casual lunch.
The space is very small and there is a limited menu. Don't let this deter you though, we really enjoyed our pasta. I selected the pesto (as I am a vegetarian) and my spouse had the bologonese. My one complaint about our experience here was the pasta was on the tougher side of al dente, tasted more like ""just cooked"" and less al dente we expected.
They are very generous with the Parmesan garnish, which who can complain about that? Yum.","Rebecca T.","The pasta noodles themselves were made well and cooked al dente. However the pasta was just okay. We ordered the spaghetti Bolognese and the pasta of the day with tagliatelle (I don't remember what was in it).
There just wasn't any wow factor or anything that made me want to ever come back... However I may just be bias because I expect pasta to taste as good as il corvo and anything less is not good enough to me.","Alice W.","Pasta here is decent and at a very good price, but definitely not close to il corvo in terms of the complexity of flavors. This store is open for dinner and weekends, though, so a decent alternative. Pasta is cooked to a perfect al dente, which I really enjoyed. The sauces are good but a bit muted/simple. We tried the spaghetti with bolognese and pesto. I like the bolognese better, especially since it had some spiciness. The pesto didn't have a strong basil flavor. We also ordered a piece of focaccia and the snap peas. The focaccia was nice and fluffy but because it's doused in sauce, the parts that weren't immediately eaten got soggy (so eat it right away!). Personally didn't like the snap peas. Half of it was celery and I didn't like that the cream wasn't fully incorporated so it was like curdled cream bits.
I would recommend stopping by if you happen to already be in the area but I don't think it's worth a trip if you aren't.","Marie B.","Chef's Vendemmia is top notch. Haven't been to Raccolto. Le Messe is a toss up. Traffic - constant downtown Seattle face palm. Finally, visited G.H. Pasta located by nearby construction and parking hell late this afternoon (11/20/19). I cannot even fathom what this place is like when Amazonia and other downtown workers have lunch here.
The kitchen staff at 1400 were still slammed, like crazy busy! The slamming of dirty pans into the dish tub added to the din. High ceilings, bright windows with today's sunshine. Tight quarters counter space wise, but lots of takeout. Dirty counters (gave our area a good wipe down at the end). Empty water pitchers and initial icky red water glasses left around (eventually refilled with ice water once I placed them at front counter...note slammed staff).
Rigatoni with tomato basil and burrata tasty, but had to have The Homie polish it off at the end. He had the Tonnerelli with Truffle Oil and copious cheese. Rich and decadent.
I know it's practical to have compostable forks and bowls, but doesn't do the pasta justice when it's for here and not takeout. Very welcomed ice water once made available. Bus your area at the end. Treat it like a campsite. Leave it better than you found it, which we did. Eat it and go, no lollygagging here. Got a parting thank you as we departed.
For those pasta bowl cravings, still prefer Il Corvo in Pioneer Square, Pasta Casalinga at Pike Place Market, Due on Broadway/Capitol Hill, and Grassa in Portland OR.
Yet G.H. Pasta gets the job done, all things considered.
Hey chef, give all of the kitchen crew a well deserved raise! That is one heck of a culinary endeavor with a high volume throughput barely one step into the weeds.","Lindsey S.","How can I say no to homemade pasta? I've had my share of homemade pasta from restaurants, and a lot of them are hit or miss. Sometimes the noodles are undercooked, and sometimes overcooked. This wasn't the case here - my noodles were cooked perfectly and had such a nice chew and bounce to them. I got the Bucatini with shrimp that was on their menu board, but was going back and forth between that and the Rigatoni. The sauce was creamy and spicy, with tiny shrimps scattered throughout. It was hearty, but not heavy, and just overall a good pasta dish, and maybe the best handmade pasta dish I've had!
The shop is super small, so there was a line out the door when I arrived, and line when I left, but I had no problem finding a spot to sit at. It seems that people just grab and go. After ordering, I waited five minutes, and they called out my number. It was hard to hear some of the numbers they were calling, because of the amount of people in the small space, but I was able to stand up front to hear better. They do everything in to-go containers, which I thought was interesting. They are sustainable, and most people DO take to-go, so it's understandable. Since it's so close to the Amazon Campus, lunch time is busy, but if you're looking for something to tie you over all day, these pasta dishes will do just the trick, just come early!","Caroline T.","Automatic 1 one star for having some 90s alternative rock blasting upon opening.
I'm not sure if they were behind because someone called out, or because of something else, but they seemed a bit rushed with opening/making sure things were out (ex: no forks at any of the seating areas). Cleanliness also seems to be a second thought, at least at the seating areas. All of the counters hadn't been wiped down, which was particuarly gross since the place just opened, which means it was left from the day before...
I was the first one in and only waited 10 minutes for my order. If you're dining in, they'll give you a little metal stand with a number and then you can choose your seating. (Plastic) Forks and napkins should be in the placeholders at the seating areas, and yes the pasta comes in the compostable bowls even though you're eating in. Once you're done, the recycling and compost bins are by the door, and there's a bin for any water glasses to be returned.
Thankfully the pasta was tasty, the sauce really was the winner. I went with the Rigatoni with Burrata, but found out after ordering they didn't have any but could sub in mozarella. Half the pasta was overcooked, but I'd prefer that over a soggy mess. Again, the sauce was really the winner and if they sold it I'd happily take home a jar. I was also relieved the sauce didn't have oil in it, as others noted some of the pasta dishes were swimming in oil.
With tip and no drink, my order came in just shy of $15. Not too bad considering this is Seattle, and it's within walking ditsance of the Amazon Campus and Space Needle. I may come back and try their bolognese, but I'd take it to go.
Lastly, I found it odd that even though I paid with a credit card the cashier was still typing in the details on the screen even though he swiped my card. Tad concerning when a cashier doesn't explain and the customer has to prompt them to.
Tips:
-Street parking (per the norm of the area), though be mindful where you park as the area has quite a bit of construction and is around several aprtment complexes. Thus, there may be stricter parking restrictions
-No set tip %, cash or credit is okay","Kevin N.","My oh my, what a truly special place this is. Located in Belltown, this new spot is making a serious case for best pasta in the city.
I came here on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. After ordering my food at the register, I was able to immediately grab a seat at the small shared table in the middle. Within 10 minutes, my number was called, and I went to the counter to grab my freshly made order.
I ordered the spaghetti with bolognese and an order of garlic bread. Typically, I'm not a fan of bolognese due to it being too sweet. However, this one was different. The sauce itself was very meaty, and it gave the dish a very satisfying, comforting feeling during my meal. And then the noodles themselves were so good. They spaghetti is thicker than the typical Parillo spaghetti you're probably used to, giving you a much more substantial bite. They were perfectly cooked to al dente - the outside still required a slight bit of effort to bite through, then the insides were super soft. They topped it with freshly shaved parmesan, which added a nice salty element as the cheese melted into the dish. By far, one of my favorite pasta dishes I've had in my life.
As if it couldn't get any better, the garlic bread was amazing. I got two hefty pieces, which was much more than what I was expecting. The bottoms developed a nice crust so that there's a brunch when you bite into it. And then the rest of the bread was super light. Topped with freshly shaved parmesan, definitely one of the best garlic breads I've had.
For how satisfying the meal was, it was very affordable. My meal was around $17, and I got a TON of food. Each pasta will cost between $11 to $14, which I think is pretty affordable compared to other places you'd go for fresh pasta.
The place is super small and located in one of the apartment buildings. It's tough to see from the outside, so be sure to follow your GPS. Inside, there's one small bar table that can seat 6, as well as maybe 10 additional bar seats. Wouldn't recommend coming in a big group, as seating can get pretty tight.
This is a super casual spot - no water service. As such, please be sure to bus your own spot. The bowls they serve their food in are compostable, and they have a tray for your used water cups.
Highly recommend this place - I'll be sure to come back to try other pasta dishes.","Ellen V.","Good place to grab some pasta to go. Lots of students in here with limiting seating. It can fit about 10-15 people or so. This is a really causal take out spot. The pasta is tasty. They have a limited menu and most of the pasta don't have any meat but still holds down in flavor.","Michelle L.","This was my first time here. This is one of the only other pasta joints that is less than $13 per dish. We ordered the truffle pasta, and the spaghetti bolognese. Also with a side of the potatoes which were really crispy and delicious! The truffle pasta was so creamy and yummy i couldn't stop eating it!! But the bottom of my bowl was a layer of oil that was a bit sad. The spaghetti bolognese was good, I liked the sauce, a tad bit acidic, but the pasta was very al dente in a delightful way! For the price, this place is not bad at all, my friend I can with said Il Corvo is still better so I am determined to try that place! I'm glad this place is open on the weekends though, because Il corvo is not.
Parking is street only because this place is near downtown Seattle, and get there early or you
Will not have room to sit down! I would return here again, maybe try the pesto or something else!","Mimi N.","Good Italian food and fast service. Cheaper than most places in Seattle. Serve generous portions. It's a small place so I will usually order food to go. The Foccacia bread is the best and quite tasty.
They are open daily from 1100-1600, including weekends.","Melissa C.","Food: ****1/2 | Service: *** | Value: ****
Yummy home made pasta! We tried the spaghetti Bolognese and daily special which has corn, arugula, and lemon. The Bolognese was amazing! The daily pasta can use a little bit more lemon in my opinion. I didn't give the food 5* because both pasta were a little undercooked. Despite this place is counter service, it takes a while to get food because they prepare the dishes as they're being ordered. Price is very reasonable ($10-12) considering the quality and quantity of food. I highly recommend this place if you're a pasta lover! @mocha_mel","Elizabeth C.","I've been wanting to try this place ever since it opened, and since I never come down to Denny Triangle anymore it's taken a while. It seems like a still-popular spot, as around lunchtime the line is sizable, but moves through relatively quickly. I waited in line to order for maybe 5 minutes? How long it takes for your food is pretty variable, though. It took maybe 10 minutes for mine, but I also saw large parties who ordered after us get theirs within 5 minutes, while my lunch buddy's food took more like 15-20. Obviously during lunchtime they are churning away, but just keep that in mind if you are looking for a ""quick"" lunch.
It's a counter service place where you can either get it for here (compostable containers w/o lids) or to go (same compostable containers w/ lids in a bag). If you can't finish your food, you can easily go up to the counter to get a lid and bag if you want. Silverware sits in containers on the few tables, as do napkins. You can serve yourself water as well.
Their menu is small with many seemingly permanent pasta items, a few appetizers, and a daily special pasta. I had the tonarelli with truffled sauce plus the fried oysters with aioli as an appetizer, while my lunch buddy had the rigatoni with tomato sauce and burrata, plus a focaccia topped with tomato, mozz, and basil. The portions here are pretty healthy, by the way; we both came pretty hungry and left very satisfied, appetizers or not.
The fried oysters were nice, but honestly not worth the price as they were quite small and they were only three that I counted. The tonarelli (a similar pasta shape to spaghetti) was cooked to al dente, well-coated in a sauce that was noticeably truffled but not one-note. As other reviewers have mentioned, this dish will reveal itself to be sitting in a pool of oil as you get closer to the bottom. I mean, yes, it doesn't look great, but just drain it out and continue enjoying it. A lot of these creamy white sauces combine cheese and oil to get that thick texture we all enjoy, so you're bound to produce some extra oil as the dish sits and cools down.
The focaccia my lunch buddy got was fluffy and delicious and came in a huge cube...and her rigatoni's tomato sauce made me feel like it was summer tomato season again.
Next time I would definitely try to get here earlier, but for the reasonable price on good quality pasta, I can see myself being a repeat customer.","Huong L.","******3.5 star******
My sister and I decided to try this place as we were in the downtown area and it was walking distance and we were craving pasta.
The inside is fairly small and probably can fit maybe up to 10 people. It's counter service so you order/pay first and then they will call out the number.
We got the daily special and the zucchini salad. The zucchini salad was pretty tasty. Definitely like the dressing that they use. It has a subtle sweetness to it. It was refreshing.
The daily special was pasta with cherry tomato, garlic, Swiss chard and parmesan. The pasta was strozzapreti which kinda looks like udon, but not as long and a little twisty. The pasta was cooked perfectly Al dente. They put in a generous portion of parmesan so it was very cheesy. The flavor was good, but I had to drink a lot of water because it was pretty rich.
Each dish was very simple, but the taste was just ok. Portion was generous though and pasta was cooked well.","Tara D.","This place has some of the best pasta I've had in Seattle! The interior is a bit smaller so seating can be hard, but the pasta is worth it. I got the truffle pasta, and the truffles were amazingly aromatic. Definitely recommend!"
"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","LeAnh N.","I've been holding off on writing a review for too long. Altura holds such a special place in my heart. Wholeheartedly I am telling you, this is my absolute favorite restaurant in Washington State. Not just Seattle. I've traveled around and tried tasting menu in different regions and always find myself comparing it to Altura.
My partner and I went to a tasting menu location elsewhere that was top notch. They offered real grated wasabi in front of us. Somehow Altura still managed to peak over that experience. The food is phenomenal! We love Chef Nathan! We love the staff!
Every experience has been so intimate and personal. If you go here please sit at the bar! I hate sitting at bars at any other restaurant but at Altura. You get to see the magic happen, and some of the time the chefs make it in front of you and deliver it right to you. Also when som thing is so good I like to ask the chefs a few questions about the dish.
We've been here so much we're able to pick up on conversations that we've left off with some of the staff. They remember what we like, what we don't. They remember all the times we've been here.
My partner and I celebrate almost every single celebration here at Altura. Sometimes we come with no celebration, just because we miss the food. I don't feel like words can describe how amazing Altura is. Sometimes I still can't believe it exists in Seattle.
There's a lot of fancy restaurant around that gimmicky. However there's just something lacking about it. Altura to me, is like a Diamond in the rough. Let's be real, you're not gonna get a super spacious table with cushion seat that looks out into the Seattle skyline. What you will get is phenomenal food and an unforgettable experience. Theres no valet, but there is food made from the best season ingredients.
If you ask me, a dinner should be about the food. So I would choose Altura's quality food and staff over valet and views any day. I'd rather have an intimate experience from a small restaurant filled with attentive staff than an impersonal experience at a restaurant. Where the staff only comes to give me my food, refills my water, and to give me the bill.
I recommend this place to everyone I love! All my friends and family knows that this is my happy place.","Michelle C.","I was lucky enough to be able to find a 2 people table on the day. They required a $100 deposits per person to book the reservations, just as a heads-up.
We like most of the dishes, but we also feel like it's more for the people who like strong flavors. It has a total of 14 courses and we just couldn't finished all since it's just simply too much, especially since the taste of each dish was very strong. I ended up feeling sick at my stomach when I left. But it didn't mean the food isn't good. Just that I'm not used to having strong tasting dishes continuously within a short time frame.
Service is ok. They have the waiter/waitress serving the dishes but there was a period of time where I couldn't find my server at all since he is the only one that I could make my order with.
We sat right next to the window, which was freezing so if you have a chance to have other seats, definitely do that.
The wagu beef was great but it's costing an extra $20 per ounce on top of your prefix menu, which I found a bit obscure.
I think in general, the food is good, but at this price point, I just expect more from this fine dinning place.","Sara V.","Went to Altura for a special occasion dinner with my husband in October. While the food was definitely good and on its own worthy of at least 4 if not 5 stars, I don't think it was worthy of the price. I also don't think the service, decor, and ambience match the price tag of this restaurant.
I actually found the stuzzichini to be the most exciting and interesting part of the menu. Lots of interesting flavors and combinations. However, as the menu went on, we became less impressed.
We also had asked to have a paper copy of the menu since we find it helpful to be able to read about what we're eating and hard to process in a loud restaurant when served each course. Once we had one paper copy, put on the side of the table out of the way, at least 4 employees asked us over and over again if they could take it (one person even asked us twice). I understand that the restaurant might prefer that each course is a surprise but at the end of the day, we are the paying customers and I feel like it's a small ask.
I also found the tables to be very close together for the caliber of restaurant and price of the tasting menu. I was not asked if I wanted a second cocktail as I sat with an empty glass for two whole courses until I finally decided to ask myself without being offered. Again, not a big deal in general, but not the attentive service I would hope for and expect at this price point. Unfortunately, would probably not return given the numerous other options in Seattle.","Daniel C.","If the Michelin folks ever decide to come to Seattle, I'll be willing to bet that Altura deserves a star or two. I booked a party of six to celebrate my parents' 50th wedding anniversary and the experience at Altura was among one of the best for dining in Seattle.
LOCATION: The restaurant is on Broadway in trendy, hippy Capitol Hill. Limited street parking but they have pay lots across the street from the restaurant.
AMBIANCE: Open kitchen, very relaxing and laid-back vibes. It doesn't seem like a typical Italian restaurant. Modern, upbeat music too.
DINNER: The tasting menu is about $150/pp and will last about 3 hours. Folks do need to decide on the main course (duck breast or wagyu), and whether to supplement the pasta dish with white truffle (~$80/gram). You'll get the smaller bites coming out quickly, and them things slow down toward the larger portions, main, and desserts. The cuisine is Italian but with a Pacific Northwest twist. The food is gorgeous and the flavors really popped.
1. The first dish of fermented potato and cured sturgeon roe set the down and blew everyone away. Potato like a smoky cloudy foam of flavor, which played nicely with the salty roe.
2. Next came this trio of clam, razor clam, and a really meaty oyster. Although served in their shells, all three were cooked by poaching and then chilled. Nice surprise and full of briny goodness.
3. Uni Cannoli was probably the most luxurious finger food ever. Listed as savory, I found this more decadent and better than a regular dessert cannoli!
4. Next came a trio of beef dishes that may have been the Chef playing mind tricks. A soft beet (not beef) sponge cake topped with smoked beef tongue. Then a pumpkin crostada with beef fat filling. Another fried
eggroll-like dish with beef crudo.
5. The duo of mussels was up next. One served in a container from the smoke of Madrona bark and the other with a nice creamy sabayon.
6. I liked the next dish of prawn served in its broth with black rice. Prawn was almost lobster-like in texture. We were less impressed with the fried shrimp heads, designed to be dipped in the broth. A bit too oily compared to Japanese Tempura-style shrimp heads.
7. Before the main course there's pasta, and its always better with some shaved white truffle. 3g for 6 people is enough and is worth splurging for. Chef Nathan Lockwood himself shaved them for our table, which was awesome! Although we did not choose duck for our main, we got a chance to taste it in the pasta along with fried sage and porcini!
8. Everyone loved the main course selection of Wagyu. Very juicy and flavorful. Less impressive was the caramel radish which I found a bit too firm. The radicchio with foie gras snow added some nice bitterness and richness
at the same time.
9. The palate cleanser before dessert was duck tea,
which reminded me of SF's Saison. A bit too salty IMHO, but my sister seemed to like it.
10. Lastly, two excellent desserts. A Creamsicle sorbet made with sumo oranges and crispy meringue wafers that dissolve on your tongue. Then, this really impressive affogato with aerated hot chocolate. The side of orange zest gelato turned out to be the boozier dessert!
Definitely recommend Altura as one of Seattle's finest restaurants. Service, creativity of dishes, and flavors are hard to beat!","Mia C.","Wow. Wow wow wow. This was one of the most exceptional culinary experiences I've ever had. Each bite was so perfectly balanced, and I left this meal of small bites completely satisfied. My favorites of the night were the foie gras rolls, prawns with foam, pasta with truffles (lemme tell ya - these truffles were spectacular and so so fresh), and smoked mussels. I had no idea what I was eating half the time but that was all part of the fun! Definitely save this for a special occasion at $500 for two!","April P.","Intimate and cozy ambiance. Satisfactory meal but missing the wow factor. I have noticed that fine dining establishments in Seattle are missing the creativity that is found in fine dining dishes in Europe and Asia. I have a shellfish allergy and I always appreciate when a restaurant will go out of their way to accommodate my allergy. My replacements contained vegetable dishes which were tasty but they all tasted very similar. I'm not sure if the other Stuzzichini or dishes containing shellfish were outstanding or not. The pasta was my favorite. Amazing pasta and the white truffle added on is worth the extra charge. They were generous with the white truffle. I chose the duck breast for my main course which was good but once again nothing memorable. Dessert was delicious. I enjoyed my meal but I did expect more.","Grace D.","This was one of the most interesting meals I've ever had. From eating popcorn with a fork to the savory cannoli, the tasting menu is extremely creative. We frequently asked staff questions that almost seemed idiotic, but they're professional to a tee. They have all the answers about the menu's creation, components, and sources. And they have great mustaches. We didn't do the full wine pairing, but we did take recommendations for a glass to start with and end with. Despite my date not being an oenophile, we both enjoyed the recommendations. Looking back, I'd make the same decisions.
I can't believe they fit us in without a reservation on a Friday night but it was such a fortunate happenstance- the less fancy place we expected to go was uncharacteristically booked. The space is intimate, giving off an active yet calming vibe. It's a modern, simple background for a baroque culinary tableau. The meal experience took two and a half hours, exactly as staff said it would. I thought time flew by. We started hungry then ended stuffed- when they brought out the second dessert course, we could barely handle it. However, their aerated hot chocolate-based dessert is so worth it!
Some of our favorite pieces were the pillowy gnocchi, stunningly plated in red with fruit and beets. Even the palate cleanser sorbets, with tarragon and fruit flavors, were delicious on their own. The locally sourced crispy duck was perfectly fatty and seasoned. Of the stranger pieces, we both loved the fermented potatoes with black butter. At the beginning, we were hoping for bowls of everything, but no course disappointed and we left fat and happy. It's also sweet that they send you off with a box with a little shortbread and chocolate truffle and a menu to remember things by.
I'm still surprised Yelp categorizes this place as ""Italian"" because that's not apt for the diversity of flavors and inspirations here. Though there was gnocchi, a savory ""cannoli,"" and a vaguely Italian dessert, this place is New American fusion in my mind.","Kayla N.","Unique and tasty foods. We did their tastings menu and classic wines pairings. We enjoyed all of the foods. It's amazing what the talented kitchen line produced. They did all sorts of dietary accommodations which can't be easy. Luckily, we have no allergies and were able to taste their offerings adulteration.
Service was friendly. Our only ding would be the wines pairings but this is particular to our wines tastes.
I would recommend anyone to give this restaurant a try. What a treat to experience unique and distinctive dishes.","Daniel F.","Meal was fine. Staff was informed in advance that my wife has a serious hazelnut allergy. They told us upfront she'd get a different dessert as a result. Nonetheless they served her the hazelnut dessert. First they apologized after she tried an obviously hazelnut bite and pointed it out. Then they said it's maybe not hazelnut, as her throat started to constrict. After a minimal subsequent apology, we escaped.
Perfectly fine meal. Pretty unbelievable that this was the service for a nearly $1k check for 2. Thankful she avoided anaphylaxis. Sigh.","Jonelle T.","Altura has been on my list for a while and we finally stopped in a few months ago during their celebration of shellfish.
Located on the quieter north end of Broadway, the restaurant is unassuming from the outside, yet cozy and casual on the inside. The décor is eclectic and the space consists of a long bar and just enough tables to still give you an intimate dining experience. The multi-course menu is fixed and changes seasonally. The food may look fancy, but you don't have to worry about fine dining protocol here.
Think about your experience here as a well thought out masterpiece. From the stuzzichini to dessert, every course was thoughtful in its composition and plating. After all, you eat with your eyes as much as you do with your stomach. While creative, every dish was still approachable, with a twist on familiar ingredients.
Our meal began with a flight of amuse-bouche style bites, including a spicy blood orange and parsley soda that packed a punch. We devolved into courses like beet sponge cake with maitake mushroom and white truffle and beef crudo with parmesan fondutta and quail egg yolk. A play on a savory cannoli with uni had promise, but was overwhelmed by chives. One of the more interesting courses was a fermented potato with black butter that just melted in your mouth. The aforementioned shellfish was delightfully presented, but very sandy, while a satsuma and sea buckthorn sorbetto proved to be the perfect palatte cleanser. Our duck was so perfectly cooked, I could've easily eaten another plate and a winter herb brodo hit the spot on a cold winter night.
Though a bit on the pricier side, I think it's worth the experience for a special occasion or just a nice night out.","Michelle L.","Taste: 5
Value: 4.5
Service: inconsistent
The good: Altura is a Michelin contender (if the team ever makes it to Seattle!) for sure given its elaborate fine dining experience from the beginning with the rapid fire courses (deliciousness in single bite form) to the flavors of their decadent desserts. I also appreciated the decor and that the chef actually hand crafted most things in the restaurant (tables included).
The bad: Altura is not quite ready for that Michelin star rating. For one, I didn't get a good story of celebrating Italian cuisine from our main course. Both the lamb and duck options (which by the way could be eaten in one single big bite...not sure how you can call that the main course) were on a bed of vegetables that were seasoned in more of an Asian inspired fashion. I just didn't get the connection. Secondly, their service needs work. Maybe our person was new, but he made several mistakes that interrupted the dinner service (I've never had servers take back unused utensils before at such a high end restaurant because we needed something else to eat for next course).
Maybe with a few adjustments, Altura can climb it's way to the top of the fine dining scene.","Allen A.","When we walked in and sat at the chefs counter, I observed a kitchen in harmony, preparing delicious smelling/looking food. I looked over their wine list(very fairly priced) and ordered the wine pairing for the 14 course tasting menu. The wife and I loved the balance in the menu starting out light and working its way to red meat. No course was too heavy on meat or seafood, and every flavor blended in perfectly within each course. Service was better than amazing. The chefs were personable, and I was gifted extra rounds of drinks. The wine selection inspired me to buy a bottle to take home. The Italian love put into the food made the course structure worth it. At the price we paid, we felt that the food was a steal. We will return 100%
(if only there was a 10/5 star option on yelp to accent the quality)","Reza A.","My wife and I don't usually do fancy dinners out, so I'm by no means an expert in the finest cuisine. But we had a special occasion to celebrate and decided to give Altura a try. And given the hefty price (dinner for two was $500 with two glasses of wine and gratuity) the most important question I can help answer: Is it worth it? And I think the answer is a resounding yes!
The service was excellent, but I think that's expected. What was less expected was the ingenuity of the courses, the wonderful taste, the fact that we had to make almost no decisions other than provide our dietary restrictions and preferences and were very positively surprised with every meal that was brought out.
Make sure to make reservations at least a few weeks ahead of time and don't be shy to share all your preferences when you make your reservation (they are very nice about avoiding things you can't eat). If you forgot, that's ok, I had forgotten to let them know to avoid dairy when I made a reservation and o lot told them during our visit and they did a great job to accommodate the courses.
Great for a romantic dinner for two but we saw larger groups with up to 6 people and they seem to have a great time.
Big fan!","Missy S.","After making plans to travel to Seattle, the first thing on the list was finding a nice restaurant to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. I ended up being torn between Metropolitan Grill and Altura, but ended up picking Altura despite it having less reviewers and a lower rating. The food at Altura looked more inventive and I was interested in having something different. I know my intro is very long, but I think it provides context. I think it's necessary to highlight the importance of meeting the customers expectations when they seek a dining experience that matches the special event being celebrated.
1. The staff is wonderful. They were professional, courteous and efficient.
2. The food is inventive and the ingredients are high-quality. The duck-best I've had and the wagyu steak was pretty darn perfect. I will say that of all the courses, I only enjoyed the pastas and main entrees, the rest of the apps didn't taste good at all and were only satisfying to the eye. The dessert was good too, but that's expected. You can't really mess up dessert.
3. Presentation was spot on and the timing of the courses was very well executed. The dishes were all specially designed for the courses and it's something I appreciate.
Now for the disappointments:
1. Rating: In Seattle, the food quality standards are described using face emojis. Excellent, Good, Okay, Needs to Improve. I was shocked to see that Altura only had a ""Good"" rating. It was the first thing I saw and it was very off-putting. I read the description for ""good"" and it's not good. Basically it's possible that Altura has some red-level violations, just not enough times to get an ""okay"" rating. Anything below the top for this kind of restaurant is again, unacceptable. Clean up your act Altura.
2. Punctuality: My husband and I arrived at 9pm and didn't get seated until 9:42. Just not acceptable for a $$$$ restaurant. Reservation made far in advance with a mandatory $200 deposit have to be prioritized and 100% timely. I can understand 15 min.. but nearly 45 min late.. ridiculous. I will give credit where credit is due, the host offered glasses of Prosecco as a mia culpa.
3. Venue: The restaurant itself is nothing special. The place in general is very unkept and it doesn't seem like much of the money the restaurant makes is invested back into decor or maintenance. There is no waiting area.. something they need if they're not going to be timely. There are a couple of chairs near the host bar and whoever sits in one of them will have coats hanging over their head. The baseboards are dirty and pretty beaten up. You can tell they only clean where they have to. There's no white glove standard here. The mirrors have streaks and there's dirt and dust under the parts that the broom or mop can't reach. The bathroom is also unkept and pretty subpar for such and expensive restaurant.
I took pictures, but they seem to have the same menu posted several times by others so I'll spare you with the exception of the food rating chart.
If you're looking for your experience to match the high cost, skip Altura.","Kate N.","Throwback to such amazing experience at @altura on my birthday. Probably the best fine dining in Seattle that I've ever had: perfection from the service, ambiance to excellent tasting menu. I kept being impressed every time new dish coming out :O . Beautiful presentation and creative combinations make everything so delicious and worth the pay!!!
P/s: Though I never expected to be full eating at fine dining restaurants but all those small bites from @altura actually made me pretty stuffed for the whole night!!","Stella D.","The creative ideas and the ambience and customer service are exceptional. No condescending look if you don't want wine matching. Very swift and punctual throughout the dinner. But do expect a 2.5-3 hours dinner since waiting for food just takes a while.
But the taste of the food have big swings among the dishes.
For $137, we get about 8 appetizers, 5 entrees and 3 dessert. Out of 8 appetizers, there are only 2-3 that actually taste normal. Some of them are way too salty, some of them are just a combination of weird flavors. I don't even know how you can make food taste so bad. The conclusion I get is they are trying too hard to be creative. It ended up the ones that have simpler ingredients actually taste the best... Even though they might look the most exciting.
The 5 entrees are generally pretty good. The celebration of winter shellfish is good other than the clam is not salty. The Gnocchi is amazing to smell and taste since we sat at the counter. The steak is definitely a highlight. The quality of phenomenal and it is cooked to the optimal tenderness and flavor. No wonder no more entrees after the steak.
The dessert is okay. Liked the bourbon caramel semifreddo the most but overall a bit too sweet. It was my birthday so they used the chocolate sauce to the draw out a happy birthday message on the last dish which is cute.
Overall good experience will recommend it for special occasion but definitely not coming back.","Ben C.","Altura has long been on my list for an indulgent dinner and I finally took the opportunity to make it out here last night. I've been to more tasting menus than I can count and the experience here feels slightly different than most, which may or may not be a good thing depending on what you prefer.
The space is really small (hey, this is Seattle) and while it doesn't really confer to me a full tasting menu experience a la Michelin like others claim (not that that's necessarily what a chef aspires to), it's really cool to see what the team is able to do with such limited space. The tabletop coal fire was placed right in front of me and was used throughout the night-- it was interesting to watch the duck breast hang over the fire and absorb some of the smoke wafting up to it and to see the oysters being grilled. The open kitchen concept comes with its potential pitfalls, though. When the team has to huddle and catch up it's awkward as a patron to see obvious conflict/turmoil happening.
The number of small bites could have made a full meal by themselves, but the amount of work that went into each was obvious. Some courses were a miss for me-- the shellfish and surprisingly the cheese courses I didn't really enjoy. The cooking was good enough to *almost* make me like olives. Most courses though were really enjoyable-- I'd kill to know how the fermented potato course was made as well as how they made the ragu so damn good. The affogato course gave the experience a feeling of a proper closing. This is the only restaurant outside of Eleven Madison Park that I've been to that is bold enough to make a dry-aged duck course, which was done extremely well.
Overall I'm super happy to have come here and hope for the business's continued success. Really, I just want to eat the dry-aged duck every night for the rest of my life.","Sara R.","I've been back three times since my initial review back in 2016, and I can scarcely remember that I ever had bad service. The food and the service have all been outstanding every visit since then, and even if there was a dish that wasn't my favorite, it was always balanced and made sense. Seattle is all about simplicity so we are lucky to have a restaurant that isn't just about simply good food, but good food that is a true experience.","Joop V.","I was at Altura to celebrate a friend's birthday and, now that I have relocated to anothet city, it was definitely one of the most aesthetically, tastefully and ambiance wise, memorable meals I had in Seattle.
The menu is a fix prixe multi course and changes regularly depending on available ingredients, and you can opt for optional courses like truffle/cheese or steak plate s and/or pairing drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic options). We had the multi course meal (everyone who went to the restaurant had to pretty much had the same thing here...with some accommodations for dietary restrictions, of course), added on the truffle/cheese course and got the half alcoholic/non alcoholic and another non alcoholic pairing.
The courses were all wonderful. They were beautifully plated and all tasted great. There wasn't a dish that I didn't enjoy honestly. I think what helped too was the portion of each dish was right. It was light and wasn't too much in quantity that you ended up feeling stuffed over the course of the meal.
I also appreciated the staff with great service mind. Even though it was a high end restaurant, the staff was friendly and there wasn't a stuffy atmosphere at all. In fact, the ambiance was intimate and they really took the time to pace out the meal and cater for each table (I knew this because we sat at the bar so we saw a bit of actions/preparations that went into their work!).
Overall, I loved the meal there. Altura will definitely be among my top picks for Seattle for those looking to celebrate special occasions.
P.S. if possible, get the bar seating of you are inclined to also observe some kitchen show and definitely make a reservation ahead of time!","Jack Y.","I visited this place when my mom came to see me in late September. We had an amazing experience, and here are the pros and cons I see:
Pros:
1. they have a nonalcoholic pairing option, which is very friendly for drivers.
2. most of the dishes were super great, and we found many of them having interesting and also enjoyable tastes.
3. service was good and very quick.
Cons:
1. I ordered their 4oz wagu steak. The steak is definitely not the top grade that would melt in your month. The taste is closer to the Australia wagu (they said the steak comes from Hokkaido). Also there were some vessels in the steak which were hard to cut. My mother had the dry aged duck. I also tasted a small piece and I felt it was a bit over cooked and dry. I don't know if it is potentially related to its dry aged nature. But in general I feel the main dishes (both beef and duck) were the least impressive ones in the whole course.
2. I asked for a table, and they placed us at the corner table which is right below the stairs. It was noisy every time someone used the stairs. There were planety of other tables empty but I don't know why they put us at that particular table."

This place fit the bill with great food and a fun vibe. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially when they mailed the shopping bag I left behind back to me in Philadelphia.
I will definitely make sure to stop back in the next time I'm in town.","Jenny Z.","Came here tonight for an impromptu dinner date and left very satisfied. This place, besides being slightly hard to find, is the cutest little nook in downtown Seattle. You feel as if you're in a completely different world vs the touristy pike place corridor.
We arrived around 6:55 PM and were pleasantly surprised it was still happy hour. The deal is actually quite good - $4 off cocktails! I ordered a mezcal cocktail (what's new?) and husband ordered old fashioned. We asked for them less sweet and they turned out great. Mine had a ginger syrup which was different vs most mezcal cocktails I've ordered!
For food, ordered brussel sprouts and beet deviled eggs to start, and split the mussels and burger for the mains. The brussel sprouts were recommended by the server. They were good, not great. Felt like I could make them myself and wouldn't order again for $12. The deviled egg was the perfect party in my mouth and something I had never tasted before! It had a slice of anchovy in it which sounds odd but tasted amazing. Burger was perfectly cooked with a nice crispy bun. The fries were cooked crisp to perfection. Mussels were in perhaps the best sauce I've ever had.
Overall food was so tasty, service was quick and attentive despite restaurant being completely full, and menu comprehensive! Will come back for sure - especially now that we know HH runs until 7 pm on weekdays!","Vincent C.","I came to Zig Zag for dinner and had a great experience in the end. My visit didn't start off great, though. The service was slow. On the night I was at Zig Zag, the restaurant was no more than 50% full. Nevertheless, I still waited nearly 25 minutes for my food.
That being said, the food was definitely worth the wait. I had the Wild Mushroom Farro, and it was the best farro I've ever had in my life! The flavor was completely balanced, with no one ingredient dominating the dish. I was also impressed with how they incorporated huckleberry into the dish. On top of that, the sauce - which I'm told was just vegetable stock with butter - was phenomenal. My only minor complaint was that some of the cauliflower was burnt. But the dish was so perfect in every other way that I can definitely overlook the cauliflower.","Yael G.","Met a friend here for some cocktails and it was really nice. I appreciated the vibe and that it wasn't super crazy loud. We got to hang out at a standing table and order our first drink before a table opened up, but it wasn't long until one did even though it was Friday night. The drink selection was awesome, and everything we ordered was great (and cleverly named). We also enjoyed our reasonably priced olives and Marcona almonds... good food, great drinks, nice vibe...","Melanie Y.","Came here for a drink Saturday night.
Cool, chill, vibe. Super low key. Little bit hidden but follow the signs down the stairs. We didn't have to wait and were seated right away. We got two cocktails and be warned they are super strong.
They have a large selection of different kinds of drinks as well as a late night menu. We didn't try any of the food but it all looked amazing.","Susan R.","Wow what a great find on a work trip! There's so many places to choose from right here in the Pike Place Market area. Lucky me, I landed at Zig Zag!
Service from Anna and Erin was spot on a dm fabulous. Technically, I believe Anna was my server yet Erin bought several things and was very attentive as well. It kinda worked as tag team service and that was just fabulous!
All the food was spot on, they had plenty of gluten-free options and the happy hour wine was very good.
My only complaint is that I ate way too much because the food was so great! My hotel is around one plus miles ...uphill. Ugh. It'll be good for me, right?!? Super good, I'll be back!","Alex O.","This place savings grace is there zig zag burger with the fried egg. That was absolutely delicious. The yolk just gushed out everywhere. Felt like I was eating a breakfast sandwich one minute and then the next second a bacon cheese burger. Also the cheese just oozed out of everywhere. Very delicious. The fries were a bit too salty for my taste though. Score: 5/5
Their snacks were very boring. The baguette with the cultured butter was good though. It comes toasted but my only compliant is that I eat too fast and the outside of the bread is too hard :(
The cheese platter was smelly!!!! It's not my cup of tea but I'm sure other people will love it","Sidong H.","As a tourist to Pike Market, it was fun to dig out this hidden gem. My bar tender friend suggest me here for cock tails. And yes, def a great spot for happy hour drinks then a walk around to enjoy the sunset.
The drink menu is huge, and the bartender is quite knowledgable about almost everything. I like the atmosphere too, as a weekday early evening, it's already a full house, towns of locals and tourists like me here for their happy hour.
I would def come back and try more items.","Tomoko R.","What a hidden(?) gem!
Great cozy restaurant and their service was fantastic. Small selections of wines but they were really good wines and reasonable.
Ordered A charcuterie plate, fried oysters, burgers and mussels. The plate was so tasty and the meats were perfectly cured, their mousse was just melt in my mouth.
Mussels were so plumped and juicy. Creamy curry? Sauce was as good as mussels. Their burgers were seasoned right and right size. Not to small or big.
Fried oysters were my fave. Small size and sweet. Everything we ordered was just divine. I would go back there for HH next time. Sooo laidback vibes and the foods were excellent!!","Erik B.","Looking for a classy, undercover jazz cafe with dim lighting, friendly staff and sleek design that totally takes you away from everyday life? Your answer: Zig Zag Cafe. Skillfully tucked away from Pike's Place market, close to the waterfront, Zig Zag offered superbly crafted cocktails and the perfect aperitif options to take a breather prior to continuing our tour of the city.
The lighting is dimly lit with old antique bottles of wine (some unopened) and cozy red lighting that makes you feel stuck in time. Each table is decked out with a candle as humble chandeliers decorate the ceilings.
We ordered a dish of deliciously tasting green & black olives with the perfect amount of garlic and zest. Complimented by a dish of pita bread and heated hummus (spiced with paprika and garlic), the food was delicious! For my cocktail, I ordered an aperol spritz - aperol campari mixed with good quality prosecco and orange zest with enough punch to keep me going.
Overall outstanding dining experience. Highly recommend! A+","Cassandra C.","I had a great experience here. I've heard a lot of good things about Zig Zig and I'm so happy I've finally made my way there to experience it myself. I ate the fries and deviled eggs off their late night menu. I loved the sultry smokey ambiance and the bartender was great. I just loved watching the art that goes into crafting their perfect cocktails. I had a simple Moscow mule, perhaps next time I'll try one of their house cocktails. The deviled eggs were so yummy! Maybe I'll be back soon to try more food!","Rica R.","Went with a small group of friends last night and we were seated pretty quickly. Drinks aren't super cheap but you definitely get your money's worth. Shared a squid pro quo and it was delicious. Only negative I would mention is that we were sitting near the door and it was a bit chilly.","Jessica C.","Nice atmosphere, wait staff prompt and friendly. Food was good. The fried clams and mussels were great. The whisky drinks even better. I love the red lighting and music.","Owen W.","Even though I'm a life long Seattleite, last night was my first time to the Zig Zag Café. The area around Pike Place is incredible now that the viaduct has been demolished, and I hope local businesses benefit from that. I loved the Zig Zag Café, excellent drinks, good food and great staff. Our server was very friendly and very accommodating when I realized too late that I had ordered something that didn't agree with my tastes. Much appreciated, and I won't wait so long for my next visit!","Cindy G.","Dark and cozy, with delicious bites and strong cocktails. We had deviled eggs, the pork skins, and almonds and olives for snacks before dinner at Cutters. The eggplant dip with the pork skins was the highlight. It was silky smooth, and not like baba ganouj, if that's what you were thinking. There's an off-menu cocktail-with-a-story, if you're interested. Called the Chas, it's bourbon, Cointreau, and other potent tastiness. A Pike Place institution, you must come to Zig Zag if you're in Seattle.","Adam C.","We stumbled upon this restaurant walking from pikes place down the water before heading over the smith tower. Zig Zag has the best mixologist in Seattle with a wide range of spirits. The food was wonderful, the staff was great and it's in a good location. The mixed drinks were excellent. An eggplant dish was superb, perfectly cooked and with the right garnish. The place is very cozy and very relaxing. The server was great in giving suggestions and the drinks were great.","Erin R.","BEST HAPPY HOUR. So many fun drinks and yummy snacks. They have one of the most extensive cocktail menus I've ever seen and it was hard to decide on just one (okay, two) to try. For snacks we had the fries which have a great balance of salt and dress black pepper and the crispy pig skin which came with a fantastic aioli.
We arrived around 5:30 and were able to get a seat on their small patio, but the inside looked nice too if the patio is full.","Alex P.","Definitely a place to visit and hang around. The barman was the best. And I don't even drink!","AJ C.","Great place for a drink at dusk....very nice selection of drinks and food. Bartenders very knowledgeable","Andrea G.","Had appetizers and drinks with a friend. Tasty all around! Fun little spot and nice patio area."

In a nutshell...
Great cocktails- it's always fun to try new drinks or their take on old drinks.
Super friendly staff- our server spent quality time explaining the cocktails and foods. We ended up taking many over her recommendations and enjoyed them. She was prompt and efficient. When we were asking questions about the food preparation she sent out the chef to answer our questions.
Food- oh wow. The wings are delicious as were the twice fried chicken thigh nugget thingys although I never tasted the sriracha in the dipping sauce. This was the first time I have ever had mac and cheese that was al dente and the pork on top was tender and flavorful. Cheese puffs were ok and the smashed potatoes were delicious also.
I love this place and would recommend it highly!!!!","Cory W.","$2 Oyster Happy Hour!
Lady Jaye deserves five stars for that alone, but here's a list of her other sparkling qualities:
Sophisticated (cocktails)
Ambitious (food)
Zero attitude (staff is so genuine and friendly!)
Smells amazing (like wood smoke and pretty people)
Try Lady Jaye, don't let her be the one that got away.","Patty T.","I was recommended by a friend to try this place out for brunch and I recommend you should too!
We came on a Saturday morning for brunch and I ordered the Hobo Scramble. I didn't know what to expect, but let's just say -- I finished the entire plate. That little biscuit was AMAZING! I can't tell you enough. As my friend would put it ""I want to live in this biscuit"" -- then the Hobo Scramble had a little bit of everything, bacon, ham, sausage, potato, and eggs. Perfection.
The restaurant is super cute, good size dining area. The inside also has a bar area with a few TVs. It looks like they have an outdoor area for the summer times. For a rainy Saturday morning, it was decently busy in there!
I highly recommend you stop by for brunch. I can't wait to go back for dinner!","Tiffany Z.","Let me tell you, this restaurant does a fine job on their food! I ordered the pork cheek Mac and cheese, forever smoked turkey drum, burrata cheese, pimento cheese puffs, butter Lettuce, oysters, and my fav garlic prawns! The meat dishes here are so flavorful and tender; honestly I felt ready to hibernate afterwards
The Burrata cheese is paired with stir fried string beans and sweet tomato topped with onion crisps. The big Burrata on top was so amazing but this dish was honestly a little confusing. I was expecting a salty taste but the sweet tomato really overshadowed the whole dish. It was def a surprising dish, not bad but I couldn't eat a lot of it. So I ate all the Burrata instead lol
The butter Lettuce had a Smokey taste but a little bland. The real highlight of the meal was all the meats and the garlic prawns. So tender and flavor! Those are must try dishes!","Dianna N.","Shrub Zero $7: Even though I enjoy making shrubs at home now because I love vinegar. I'll still try it when I'm out for new flavor ideas. The rotating flavor that day was huckleberry and it was a really pretty flavor. I'm not sure if the huckleberry was just overpowering or I've become so used to shrubs the vinegar doesn't hit me as much anymore, but it was still nice and refreshing.
Smoked Bologna Sandwich $14: This is also available during brunch which is Saturday and Sunday 10 AM - 2 PM. I ended up not really liking the mustard on this, and it kind of took over the sandwich flavor wise. It's been ages since I've had a bologna sandwich in my school days, but the meat on this didn't taste super different from what I remember. I did enjoy the broken potatoes as the side.
White Cheddar Grits $5: This was a good portion size for sharing as a side. In terms of grits alone, it was pretty good. My favorite grits were at Fiddlehead when they were open, but I'd order it with a side of sausage gravy. Now I like the grits at Witness in Capitol Hill which has it with bacon gravy for brunch. Basically I'm saying I need gravy to really go next level regarding my enjoyment of grits.
Overall although the food was alright, there's not much else on the current menu I feel inclined to try. I'll probably check on it now and then as I'm definitely open to giving it another shot if something catches my eye.
*****
My Star Ratings:
1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry.
2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return.
3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to.
4 Stars - Yummy! Will definitely return if I haven't already.
5 Stars - AMAZING!!! Would plan my day or even a trip around eating here.","Gen V.","Lady Jaye is a super cute restaurant in West Seattle, and I would recommend it. Located right on California Ave, the restaurant serves for a central place to get there. a good version of Southern, casual food and BBQ. Prices were ok and not ash (maybe ranging about $11-$20 for an entree). Though their menu is not expansive, there are a couple of things we tried that were flavorful and just the right amount of saltiness (such as the garlic shrimp and beef cheeks). Also, Customer service-wise, the waitress was very nice and would consider coming back.","Jennifer O.","Came for brunch. Food was not bad. Service was excellent though.
Food: I went for the basic breakfast... pretty sure that's the name. It came with two eggs, crispy bacon, home fries and a biscuit. The dish literally came out within 5 minutes of ordering. Not sure if this was impressive or concerning... BUT the food was tasty. There were 4 slices of bacon - a ton! The home fries were just okay... they were kind of mushy and I usually like my potatoes crispy. The biscuit, while good, was not the best I've ever had. It was a good texture but lacking flavor even when paired with butter and jam.
Service: we were promptly greeted and seated when my husband and i strolled in at 11am on a Sunday. The service was very warm, friendly and attentive. This restaurant has only been open for four months so I can only hope they sustain this level of service for years to come.
Atmosphere: if I recall correctly there was a bar in the restaurant so wouldn't be surprised if this spot did happy hours and such. We didn't get anything to drink though for brunch. I liked the size of the restaurant - not too big, not too small. The woman who took our check mentioned they have a beautiful patio out back which is super popular during the summer, but we didn't see it in person.
Overall: good standard brunch fare, could use a bit more oomph though. Service is excellent however.","Barbara S.","Stopped in here for Happy Hour and it was fantastic. It was a little chilly outside, but not raining so we opted to sit outside by their huge fire pit.
Our server came out pretty quick after seating us and we ordered a couple of whiskey warm drinks. They were delicious. Their HH menu is pretty good too. We had a variety of items to try.
Food is good, service is good, however, it was a little pricey because we ordered drinks that weren't on the HH menu. Overall, a definite must go back to!","Kristina B.","Cute little bar tucked on California Ave. Great space to catch up with friends or grab a drink. I've only been for dinner on a Friday night and it was a good vibe. Ordered a local beer and the chicken wangs with a side of mac & cheese. All of which was a really delicious pairing. My friend ordered the turkey leg which was huge! - the meat fell off the bone nicely, similar to having it be sous vide. The bar has many options to choose from and the menu was simple yet promising. Customer service was great and engaging, not too bothersome or not enough, just right! This place definitely prides themselves in quality (food, service, aesthetics) without being too overbearing. Brunch looks like it would taste good. Will definitely come back again!","Jordan O.","Nice little spot off California Ave with Ron Swanson on the TVs lol. I ordered 3 dishes. the mushroom dip with chips, the pork cheek Mac and cheese and the pork collar pastrami plate .
Mushroom dip - very flavorful, big fan
Mac and cheese - pork cheek is amazing, super tender and my favorite part of the entire meal, the Mac and cheese was really creamy how I like it but a little salty
Pastrami plate - the pastrami was really good, also very tender, they really pay attention to the details when it comes to their meats
Drinks - Japanese vesper was on special, incredibly smooth and had the faint taste of a stick of juicy fruit gum, loved it.
Over all good experience here, only reason it's not a 5 is, it was pretty pricey. An app, 2 entrees and a couple drinks were $100+ but that's Seattle for ya","Alexandra R.","Went here on New Year's Day for brunch. We have been wanting to try this place for a while. The place was packed! The staff was really friendly. We both had coffee and tried their fresh orange juice. Both were delicious. This was the first fresh squeezed orange juice that actually tasted like it was fresh!
I had the chorizo scramble and my husband had the breakfast sandwich. Both were so good! The chorizo tasted so fresh and perfectly spiced. The sandwich had deliciously smoked Canadian bacon on it.
I am so happy we just checked this place out. I can't wait to come back for dinner and another brunch! Love having this great place in west seattle!","Jane M.","A nice bar in west seatttle. The drinks are amazing but the food is okay. Where do we start. We ordered the buffalo trails, eagle rare version of scotch and the bourbon crusta. Each of these drinks were mind blowingly delicious. They do have a full sized bar with a lot of rare or hard to find liqour as well. We ordered the chicken wings and were not impressed with it. Loads of seating, staff is friendly, service is great. Highly recommend to stop by for drinks.","Leilani M.","The food was absolutely delicious! I cannot remember the servers name, unfortunately, but she was an absolute delight! Kind and patient, she let us explore the menu and offered suggestions when appropriate.
I got the mac and cheese, which was orgasmic. I didn't bother taking a breath between bites!
Our server suggested the lava cake with peanut butter ice cream for dessert. HOLY MOLY. Absolute perfection","Nicole F.","I heard lots of good things about this place and had a friend visiting the day they were offering their first brunch. I figured that would be a perfect day to check them out!
The ambience was nice - could be good for a date or just with friends. They were playing some great bluegrass music, which I definitely appreciated. Our waiter was really friendly and checked on us appropriately.
The menu was limited. I had a hard time choosing something off the menu, which is normally a good problem to have, but in this case, it was because nothing really stood out.
Ended up choosing the chorizo scramble with a jalapeño crema and potatoes. The scramble was meh. The chorizo wasn't really the chorizo I was expecting (i'm thinking red and spicy - this was grey and mild). Wasn't very flavorful overall. I think I could've made a better scramble at home to be honest. The potatoes were really good, though! My friends all raved about their potatoes. No one really said anything about their actual meal. The potatoes were salty and perfectly crispy.
I got a bloody mary which was clearly spiced and seasoned. Just the way I like it. My friend got the smoked pineapple mimosa which was very interesting! It didn't taste smoked at first but got smokier and smokier as she got to the bottom, until it was too smoky. Not sure if it wasn't mixed well or something. Ill give that a pass though since it was interesting!
Overall, the food was meh (again, only reviewing brunch). I would like to come back to review their dinner options because I've heard such great things (but I also saw reviews saying not to believe the hype, so who knows). I could also come back just for drinks!","Christian C.","I went to Lady Jaye on a Sunday morning for their brunch. I had heard about this restaurant from word of mouth and I wanted to try it out. I was greeted warmly by Mona who quickly got me a menu. I decided to order the shrimp and grits. i have not found good shrimp and grits in Seattle. I've had amazing shrimp and grits in the South in places like New Orleans and Atlanta. However, the grits I've tried in Seattle taste like cement. When I received my plate, I was surprised by the arugula on top of the shrimp grits. It was definitely a Pacific Northwest twist on the dish. I loved that the arugula had a pleasant vinaigrette on it. The actual grits were the right texture and immersed with chunks of Andouille sausages that gave it great flavor. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and mixed well with the creamy grits. This was definitely the best shrimp and grits I've had in Seattle and anywhere outside of the South. As I was leaving, the place started filling up. It has a good vibe to it with friendly staff. I would highly recommend Lady Jaye with their Pacific Northwest twist on American comfort food. It's definitely a gem in the Junction in West Seattle. I never go to West Seattle but I would go out of my way to come out here again for Lady Jaye.","Audrey C.","I went to Lady Jaye a couple weeks ago for dinner with some friends, and had a good experience. I didn't order any cocktails -which they are known for- so that was a bit of a mistake. The food overall was good, nothing really blew me away though, that said, we only tried a few of the menu items.
I'm planning on going back and trying a cocktail (or two) in the near future","Victoria G.","Finally, a great cocktail place in West Seattle Junction! Right in the heart of Alaska Junction, a really cool place for cocktails and dinner. I really enjoyed the service, food and cocktails. My only recommendation would be to change music: it might be personal but I would tone it down. Otherwise, a great place with a cool vibe and delicious cocktails.","Jennifer H.","After 20 years, Lady Jayes has knocked Jaks grill off the top of my favorite restaurant list.
It's hard to settle on one dish to review but the burrata is definitely my favorite even though I was skeptical at first. Hot beans with cold cheese? No thanks! BUT oh my gosh! After the first bite of creamy salty goodness, it's yes please!! Then there's the pork cakes and the mushroom dip with house made chips!! Soooo deelishus.
I'm not usually a fan of crazy cocktails but I love have they pull together a bunch of interesting ingredients and make it work. I have to have a Strawberry Manilow every time I go.
I love the ambiance. The lighting, decor and music make it a place I could hang out all day. It's so comfortable and welcoming.
The staff are hands down my favorite part. They are so excited about their product and even more excited to share it with you and it shows. Everyone I have talked to has been so gracious and humble.
I look forward to every time I get to go. Hmmmm maybe brunch on Sunday???","Danielle F.","Holy cow, the pork pastrami plate. How could brisket or a Reuben get any more delicious? Corned pork. So rich and fatty and flavorful. Served on a beautiful cutting board with onion rye, stone ground mustard, a pickle, and house-made sauerkraut. I loved the concept of assembling your own open-faced reubens - ensures nothing gets soggy and each bite has the perfect mix of flavors.
Next time, I want to try the giant turkey let with Mexican fixings (ancho bbq sauce, lime crema, cilantro, etc.) - looked pretty delicious.","Andrea M.","Oh my god, this place was good. I can't think of one thing I would change. We got in around 4 on a Saturday and it was happy hour (yay!) some of their signature cocktails were 2 dollars off and they had food deals. I opted for a Guns and Rosemary gin cocktail and it was delicious! It came with a salted rosemary rim and I was pleasantly surprised that it was not overpowered by the rosemary and it was just the right amount of sweet. I had two of these babies it was too good to switch to something different.
Whoo, okay distracted by how good that cocktail was. Let's talk ambiance. It's a little dim lit but basically the perfect amount to be relaxed. Just being there made me feel cool, it's a little rustic, a little hip, they have a huge chalkboard with the specials written out. What more can you ask for? We were there for a date night and this delivered for a date night mood for sure.
Service was awesome! Our waitress was the perfect amount of attentive while also letting us enjoy our food, drinks and each others company. We never had anything we didn't need and when I annoyingly decided I wanted oysters after we ordered everything else 5 minutes before she was very nice about.
And finally the food! I want to eat here every day. We had 4 oysters on the half shell with a tobasco ice topping that comes on the side. The tobasco Ice wasn't overwhelming and you could still taste the flavor of the oyster. We also had the pork cheek Mac and cheese and pork collar pastrami platter. I was a little hesitant when I saw the mac and cheese had arugula on it but it was heaven. All of the flavors went so well together, now I'm wondering if I should put arugula on my Mac and cheese more often. The pastrami plate was also amazing. It was the fanciest deconstructed rueben I've ever had. The meat was smoky and juicy served with delicious crispy toast, thousand island dressing, mustard, pickles and sauerkraut.
We will be back to try the bologna sandwich."

And then, the skies opened up, the clouds cleared, and the sun shined down on Sazon Kitchen in Ballard and there was rejoicing, seriously, I was rejoicing!!!!
I drive by here everyday, every, single, day and I did not realize that this was a Mexican food joint until one evening I noticed the word, TACO on the side of a trailer outside the building. I immediately did an illegal U-Turn and turned right onto incoming traffic (no one was hurt completing this maneuver) and a ran up and placed my order.
I ordered five Tacos, three Carne Asada and two Carnitas and let me just say that when I saw them I knew they were going to be good!!!
These Tacos were made perfectly, Corn Shells topped with Meat that was tender and flavorful, covered with Onions, Cilantro, and just a touch of Diced Tomatoes, perfect!!!
I have been in Seattle for eight months and Sazon Kitchen served me the absolute best Tacos, hands down, nobody else is even in a close second, that I have had in a very long time and I now have a go to Mexican Restaurant that I will be visiting often!!!
The Service was wonderful, the food was fresh and delicious, the restaurant was clean with a very inviting feel to it and the price was perfectly reasonable ...... CAN'T ..... WAIT ..... TO ....... GO ......... BACK!!!!
There are so many other things on the menu that I am looking forward to trying!!
Until next time my fellow Yelpers ..... Be Local ...... Live Local ..... and whenever possible ..... BUY LOCAL!!!!!","Jelena S.","First timer here! Super cool they have a restaurant and a taco truck on the lot too. Cool feel to this place and there was parking in front.
I got the machaca de res with verde chilaquiles to go.
The potatoes were not cooked through- legit hard pieces and dried out. No flavor, disappointing.
I was in front when I called for pick up so there was no time waiting for the food so WHY were my avocados black??
Not enough verde sauce on the chilaquiles.
The best part was obviously the meat but it was lacking flavor as well.
For a $20 plate, I better be enjoying my meal and this was subpar.","Angel B.","This is a hidden gem! I first found this place when my friends posted about it on the good ol' IG stories. I love Chilaquiles and immediately tried this place out the next day.
The pros:
Great portions and speedy service. You walk up to the counter to order here and bus your own dishes, so it's a very casual environment (which I like!). I've tried the Dicorciados Eggs (one of their chilaquiles based dishes) and also their signature dish, the Machacha de Res (shredded beef, potatoes, chilaquiles, eggs, tortilla, beans... YUM!!). Both are excellent! The Machacha de Res is splittable between two people if you're not SUPER hungry, otherwise, you will probably have some leftovers.
The cons:
Could have a bit more indoor seating, although the outdoor seating is heated and that helps.","Camille W.","Mexican breakfast, heck yes!
We came here after enjoying the Ballard Farmer's Market and was pleasantly surprised by our choices. I enjoyed the fact that we ordered our food inside -very laid back. Also, a little confused as to where the Mediterranean description fits into the menu, I only saw one item that was Mediterranean - toast.
The trick is to go for the Machaca de Res and something sweet like the French Toast. It comes out as a massive entree, which I had to share with my family. The beans were perfect and the cheese wasn't what I expected it had a squash-like texture and flavor. The meat was so tender and paired well with the rest of the meal, like the eggs and the tortilla chips. My mother got the french toast which was excellent as well, could've done with more syrup but it came with some sort of vanilla pudding with fruit pieces, which I know adds moisture to the dish. Everything was fresh but could've used a dash or two of salt and spices which leaves it at a 4 star experience.","Michael R.","First time here and the food was excellent. I had the Signature Machaca de Res and press pot coffee. The perfect morning!","Fiona X.","I think I found my new favorite brunch spot. Sazon's is order at the front, and they'll bring the food to your table.
We sat on the patio with our friend's pup, and got our food very quickly after. The machaca de res plate is AMAZING and absolutely enormous - it had beans, potatoes, 2 eggs, chilaquiles with avocado, the machaca itself, and then 3 big tortillas (probably 6"")! The tortillas are amazing. I barely ate half of this entire plate. My friend demolished his plate.
My boyfriend's egg sandwich had super fluffy, amazing scrambled eggs, beans, and perfectly crisp bacon all on a soft but crispy on the outside bun. It was unreal. The side potatoes were really crispy and flavorful.
Total for 2 machaca dishes + 1 egg sandwich + a Mexican coke + a coffee = ~$50. Service was super lovely and friendly.","Anyong N.","I love this place. I keep trying to figure out other ways to say it, but there it is. We have had delightful breakfasts here and go *often*. I like the grain bowl, the shrimp omelette (the best!), a couple of dishes that are named but those names escape me at the moment... but they're all great. All of the people working behind the counters are kind to us and food comes out quickly.
The hot sauce is inspired, as I think it's prepared the same way you would for Chinese chili oil, but smoky and (also) delicious.","Lita G.","Great food and friendly service, what else could you ask for?
For years I didn't like ""mexican"" food, that was until I went to Mexico and tried the real stuff, which not many places in the US seem to go for. Sazon though is a great example of how to do mexican food right. Their menu is original and so well executed. They have an excellent variety of breakfast and brunch dishes, and now they even serve mimosas.
The restaurant is very casual, and you have to order at the counter, but they are very quick at bringing things out. Also, they have wifi and are dog friendly. What else could you ask for?","Wei H.","As my friend and I were looking through the menu about to order, we also couldn't help but notice the line outside Un Bien, home of arguably the best sandwiches in Seattle. We were like should we go to Un Bien instead? Then we rationalized by saying, Sazon has so many 5-star reviews! And this patio is cute on this sunny day. Let's just stay. I should have just acted on my instinct in this case.
The food at Sazon tasted fresh and good, but it was definitively, nothing special. I wanted to get the shrimp omelette but they were out of shrimp so substituted with steak instead. My friend got the shredded beef (machaca de res). Maybe because this is breakfast food, but I was not really impressed with the flavors. My steak was a bit dry, and the omelette was too firm if you know what I mean. The refried beans were fantastic, even though I don't usually like them. Potatoes were a snooze.
The people running the business seemed genuinely nice, but I don't think I will return even if I am in the neighborhood. Maybe I will try the taco truck next time. The free coffee with check-in was nice, tho.","Kaushik B.","Food : I ordered Macha De Res as carry out . Tasted real good with the serving size as per the price paid . The food portion is filling for sure . No complains on the taste or quality .
Ambience : This place opened up 3 mo this ago and gets busy for breakfast and weekends . I wish they are open for longer. Very well Maintained and nicely organized outdoor seating vs indoor tables.
Service : The people are responsive and they recognize if someone visiting more than once unlike most of the restaurants in this neighborhood .
Hopefully they keep up this personal rapport for longer .","Preetha A.","Fresh ingredients, great service, loads of unique menu offerings and lovely ambience. We have needed a good Mexican place in seattle for a very long time and this spot delivers the goods!
Comparing this spot against other the more authentic mexican spots like el camion, la carta oxaca and fonda la catrina. This place is in between the two- more trendy than fonda and more upscale or hipster than el camion. They also have the taco food truck parked outside on weekends which i plan to try soon.
Now for the food- there are so many options. We asked the guy at the counter for recommendations and settled on the Divorciados eggs( eggs with chilaquiles, red and green salsa, crema , beans, avocado) for the vegetarian( with eggs) and the Arrachera and eggs (asada, eggs, chorizo, chilaquiles, greens, bread, beans) for the hard core meat eater.
We rounded it off with theo blend coffee which was free for first time visitors with yelp checkin, and the freshly squeezed orange juice. It is rare to find a spot with great service, menu and ingredients.
The chorizo was probably the best tasting - though everything was very good. Meat portions were small but the entire dish was more than filling and a huge serving. Definitely recommend and would take friends to this new spot next time!","Andrew L.","40 minutes. That's the wait time from when I ordered, and when my wife and I received our meal. Somewhere inside the timeframe, our first cup of coffee didn't arrive until my wife went to the counter, then I went to the counter, and then after waiting a few minutes longer, we finally got coffee. I'd say it took 15 minutes after I ordered, and two reminders we ordered coffee, that we got coffee. Let's also explore the scenerio when it came to our flatware.
For a place that makes you get your own flatware, they didn't have any forks available for the first 20 minutes in the trays. It didn't matter so much, since our food took twice as long to get, but I cold clearly see other folks going to the trays, seeing them empty, then looking like, ""Well darn, how am I suppose to eat my meal with a steak knife?""
Also, let's also examine the scenario that the table got their flatware delivered to them... weird... also they were two fairly attractive young females (20s), and one of the servers (young male) decided they should have their flatware delivered to them.. this was before they refilled the tray for all the other customers... and he was definitely flirting them them (trying.. to anyway).
Also, let's talk portions. When were finally presented our food, I had ordered Arrachera & Eggs.. which is Skirt steak marinated, accompanied with eggs. To be clear, the menu mentions ""Asada & Mexican Sausage"".. which the steak was obvious (not tender but on the plate).. the sausage was basically missing. What was provided was about a single spoon full worth of sausage.
Overall, it wasn't a very good experience. Yes, it was a busy day, and I'm sure there was a confluence of things to get this particular experience, but it happened. Unfortunately what was going to be an exciting experience trying a new local restaurant, wasn't.","Ellen C.","Love the vibe of this place! Order up front and grab a seat. The food took awhile but it was worth it since it seemed that they made everything from scratch. Huge portions, a lot of options, friendly staff. While crowded wasn't annoyingly crowded. Such a great spot for brunch. Option to sit outside too if you can grab a seat. If you check in on yelp, you get a free cup of coffee!","Jessica G.","Great little stop for a tasty breakfast. The Mediterranean toast was delicious. Topped with two over easy eggs to make the perfect gooey brunch. The humans and feta atop the cheese made it enough for a meal.","Jonathan D.","Surprisingly those 5 stars reviews are legit!
Small cozy place, super friendly service, fun music and atmosphere and most importantly delicious food!
Generous portions too!
Not your typical Mexican place here in Seattle.
Definitely worth stopping by.
Trust me, I know food.","Vijay S.","This is a 3.5 star review. Their taco truck gets 4 stars and the restaurant gets 3
Pros
- excellent service and friendly staff
- nice cafe setup
- Amazing tacos
Cons
- I ordered the chiliquiles and added some chicken.
It was ok. The chicken was tasty but having lived in CA and eaten a lot of Mexican food...it wasn't en par with what someone would have there","Morgan J.","Gets very busy on a weekend around 9:30-10 am! Sazón has outdoor seating so it was great to bring our small dog. The staff are friendly and helpful. I ordered the chilaquiles but didn't read the description- they don't come with an egg and I found it pretty bland without the egg. The staffperson told me that the divorciados is a similar Option that comes with an egg. My dad ordered the breakfast sandwich and that was good.","Shauna N.","The menu is very interesting it was hard to decide because everything sounded so good. I got the Machaca de Res and it was a little greasy but very good. I really liked the coffee too. They have a very small parking lot but I was able to park on the street. There is a great patio to sit at in the shade.","Kristin H.","Such a great new spot!
I knew the food was going to be good from these reviews--I didn't expect the dining experience to be so nice though. The patio is lovely on a sunny day, and the presentation of the food is really elegant. The food itself is delicious. From the oatmeal to Rosita's eggs to the Machaca de res... everything was amazing. Also, the portions are BIG.
I am so happy Sazon Kitchen is here. Between it, Un Bien, and Watson's Counter, 15th is becoming the place to eat!","Mike F.","Finally made time for breakfast at Sazon Kitchen and was quite pleased. Can recommend the Huevos Divorciados and the Mollettes. I certainly expect to go back and try more dishes! The way the staff interacted with one another seemed to indicate Sazon is a happy place. They were very friendly and helpful with us, explaining what different menu items are.
The coffee is strooong, thank goodness there's water to mellow it out. However, there's only powdered coffee creamer. Help I need a little half & half. UPDATE, UPDATE: they have half & half in the fridge, just ask :)
This place is worth a trip."
"La Fontana Siciliana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fontana-siciliana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Liz F.","OMG, this place was charming! I came here with two others for a mid-workday lunch on a Friday. The place was empty at lunch, but I hear that's not the case for dinner.
We were welcomed by our server, who was attentive, friendly, and genuinely seemed to love his job. The restaurant is small, but it's warm and inviting. I felt like I was transferred back to somewhere in Italy.
The server took time to learn our wine interests and made recommendations, bringing out several for us to taste. We ordered our food and it arrived quickly. The menu is fairly traditional (meaning it's light on the meat options).
I ordered the risotto and WOW was it good. My mouth is watering just thinking about it....
Between the food, service, atmosphere, and good wine... I will surely be back.","Derek R.","I don't know what happened last night, but we'll never be back. Had an 8pm reservation. After being seated nothing happened. No one said a word to us. No quick hello. No drink order. No ""be right with you"". Sat there until 8:15, and this place isn't that big. I know 15 minutes doesn't sound like a long time but when you are just sitting there in a tiny room, believe me, it is. Started to get worried that no one around us had food. When I thought a server was finally coming to us she stopped at a table next to us that had been seated at least 30 minutes and asked if they were ready to order. Nope. We had a show to go to and this almost hijacked the whole evening. We left.
By the way, quick note, take this as you will. A young poorly dressed couple came in when we were waiting. Like, girl was wearing a Rugrats T-shirt. They looked scruffy but seemed like a nice couple looking for a date night. They asked if there was a table available and the girl said no, fully booked all night. Literally a minute later a better dressed older couple comes in, asks same question, gets told there's a 20 minute wait. My wife and I were like ""hmm, that just happened"". I imagine some might like they do this, protecting their otherwise nice ambiance, but watching it happen was off-putting to us.","Mia Z.","I firmly believe this is one of the best Italian, well Sicilian restaurants in town! Everything on the menu is goooood. We got sardine pasta and tonight's special scallop spicy tomato sauce linguini. AMAZING.
Then we had Panna cotta and tiramisu for dessert. Such a lovely place. Perfect for dates and important anniversaries.","Victoria Y.","La Fontana Siciliana is the best restaurant I've ever been to! The staff was so welcoming and friendly. They all went above and beyond for my boyfriend and I while we dined. Our server, Ray, was very kind and attentive. We were from out of town and he gave us great recommendations on what to order as well as other things to do around Seattle. The owner, Mario, served us our food as well as dessert. My boyfriend ordered Chicken Marsala with pasta and I ordered the Fettuccini Ai Funghi. Both dishes were incredible. We got a cannoli and tiramisu for dessert, and both were phenomenal. I can't recommend this restaurant enough! It is a must.","Heidi M.","My husband had been wanting to take me here for years, but I could never find anything on their menu (online viewing) that I thought I would enjoy.
We came in on New Years eve, without a reservation. After waiting about 5 minutes, we were seated at a cozy table in the corner.
We started with the arugula salad and soup of the evening, which was a white squash soup..super tasty.
As our main entree, we ordered their two specials. One was lobster fettuccini and the other was Osso Bucco with risotto! OGM..both were outstanding!!
We brought our own bottle of wine, but each enjoyed a delicious glass of champagne while our wine was breathing:)
Our server was great. The only thing I didn't like was the complementary bread...not my style...but everything else was AWSOME!
Can't wait to return!","Michael N.","Great little hole in the wall. If you want a near Italy-like experience, eat outside. The tree canopy and surrounding apartment complexes add to the experience as if you're actually in Italy. The service was excellent. Waiters and owner herself checked on our table frequently to make sure the food and experience was high in quality to which it was. You must go for the black linguine and smoked salmon. One thing that prevents this place from being a perfect 10 for me is that the surrounding area is full of questionable people. One example was a man who was offering free blowjobs. But being a great little hole in the wall, it really takes you away from all that noise even if the free blowjobs were waiting for you outside.
Food: 9/10
Dining experience: 9/10
Overall: 9/10","Jennifer G.","My boyfriend and I went here during a short weekend trip to Seattle so I can't say of it's the best Italian restaurant in town, but I have a hard time imaging what they could do better. Our server, Ray, was attentive and friendly. He seemed to genuinely like his job and even took time to talk to us about Seattle and give us some tips on places to check out.
The restaurant is definitely a small hole in the wall but the decor is nice and the tables were cozy without being cramped.
We started with the calamari which is served in an amazing pesto sauce. I had their fettuccine ai funghi. If you like mushrooms I'd definitely recommend it. My boyfriend ordered the tortellini in a meat sauce. It was yummy and super unique.","Shannon L.","This place is the perfect romantic date spot, although, for my first visit, I took my children. It has been open for 25 years. They have a piano player on Saturday nights who has been playing there for all 25 years. Apparently, the menu hasn't changed, either. I had mushroom risotto, which was delicious, and my daughter had cheese ravioli, also delicious. My son said it was the best cheesecake he's ever had in all 8 years of his life.","Ben C.","Note: I would say the restaurant is more of $$$ than $$ as your price per entree will likely be over $30 a person if you're going for the more decent dishes but not surprising as it seems like the spot is made for ambiance.
We got the bruschetta to start and two glasses of red wine. The bruschetta had a bit too much garlic and wasn't easy to eat as the bread is tough. Flavor-wise it wasn't bad but I don't know if strong garlic breath is what I wanted after this dinner.
For main entrees, we got the Risotto ai Funghi and a squid ink pasta topped with calamari and a few prawns. The risotto was the most expensive bowl of rice I have eaten. I did enjoy the flavor of the risotto though and it definitely is rich. However, I don't think it looked great so... presentation was a bit lacking. The squid ink pasta itself was mediocre at best. ""Meh"" was my thought after taking a few bites.
I did like the fact that they brought out a tray and explained the desserts before we decided on one. The tiramisu was a bit overly sweet and lacked more coffee notes.
Towards the end, I could see many tables start to leave while we did not get the check. We finished around 9 PM and stood up around 10 PM to walk up to the counter. It was only then that the wait staff asked us if we were ready to check out. Places like pho restaurants do that because service is not really a thing there. For a restaurant of this caliber, that can be pretty unacceptable and it made me uncomfortable as I did not want to flag someone down.
Overall not very impressed with the food portions or quality. Even though the spot was cute, my partner and I don't think we'd come back unfortunately as we've had much better for a more reasonable price in the area and more attentive service.","muftia k.","Absolutely amazing! Food was perfection, staff was so genuinely friendly and accomodating. Hostess was so sweet and Mario was the best server we could ask for. Perfect place for a nice night out.
Thank you guys for such a great night!","Jason R.","Fantastic food! Quaint little Italian place. Family of four and every dish was incredible; even the plain old cheese ravioli - has a perfect sauce that takes it to the next level. Not a white table cloth, upscale place but that makes it feel better; like Itialy, you feel
loke you could get a bottle of vino and just eat for 45 mins on the amazing food while chatting with friends (or strangers at the next table). Wine pours were very generous and while it wasn't a typical name brand wine list the wines were very good. Outdoor seating wasn't available but I could envision amazing ambience if it were. Wait staff was very helpful with my teenagers that asked lots of questions, I felt like they wanted you to have a great experience.
Will be back for sure.","Jennie L.","On a rainy day in Seattle, my husband and I who are Canadian stumbled onto this place. We actually only picked it because it was quasi close to our hotel and we didn't want to be stumbling around in the dark, in the rain. We were glad we did. Really sweet and romantic place. Charming, with a intimate setting for a date night. Loved the chandelier. Our server was kind and quick, answering our questions about the menu and giving suggestions. Really great server. I decided on the home made linguini with smoked salmon in a lemon cream sauce. My husband ordered the spicy sausage penne with a tomato based sauce. I also ordered a glass of wine. I have to say, with the low prices to high quality wine in the stores, I was disappointed with the price per glass of wine. And no half liter house wine specials. This should be a given in a Italian restaurant. Prices were slightly high but in the acceptable range of what we were generally eating in Seattle. Definitely my pasta was the winner. Delicious springy noodles in a rich creamy lemony sauce with generous portions of salmon. My husbands pasta was pleasant enough and generous enough, but the home made noodles made my dish shine. Definitely worth a check if you are wanting a romantic date night.","D R.","This place is awesome, everyone loved what they ordered and didn't think the price was that high for Seattle, if anything the waiter was clumsy at times (maybe first day?), But nothing a good meal can't fix, will definitely keep going more","Stan E.","Amazing food, incredible service. Treated like family. Best ravioli I've had. Server Ray is awesome, honestly above and beyond service - knows the menu and all of his recommendations were on point.
Thanks to everyone for making this a memorable night with great friends and fantastic food!
Cheers!","Conor S.","Delicious. Generous. Timely. This place delivered on all accounts. I went with two friends and none of us left disappointed. The service was friendly and quick. We were able to sit outside because of the good weather. I ordered risotto and it was so rich and delicious. I can't complain at all.","Yoona K.","Had high hopes because almost everything we tried in Seattle was good, but La Fontana Siciliana was just standard Italian for my liking. The outside area was super cute/beautiful for date night. They have tables surrounding a pretty fountain right next to the entrance of the restaurant. The interior is also very intimate and tiny. My seat was pretty uncomfortable because I was so close to the table behind me...
The food was good but nothing stood out where I wanted to come back. We ordered the Fettuccine ai Funghi and the Fettuccine del Bosco. The serving size was also pretty small compared to most other Italian places I've been to. Normally I will have to always take at least half of my pasta dish to go but this place made me feel like I needed to order more after my meal... The service was pretty slow and the waiter barely checked up on us. Food 3/5, Service 3/5. There seems to be a lot of other Italian places nearby. If you are visting Seattle like I was, I would recommend going to try somewhere else.","Geana N.","My husband and I brought my cousin who's visiting from out of town.
The restaurant is super intimate and radiates a rustic, authentic Italian restaurant. The space is small and the decor is of neutral stucco, with purposeful cracks in the walls that added to the old world Italy feel.
They have a piano, and at the the time we were there, they had a pianist playing. This is a very romantic space. You would not know this restaurant is located in Belltown because it's hidden behind tall gates where It appears that there is only a water feature. The restaurant is off to the side within the little courtyard.
We did enjoy the food. But it wasn't so super delicious that I will crave the meal again. Service was slow and unconventional particularly with the wine. They opened a bottle and put it on the table without asking anyone to taste it first. They didn't keep our water glasses refilled so we shared our water.
3 stars for the lovely atmosphere, good meal, slow and not up to par service staff for this type of restaurant.","Scott D.","In the pantheon of Italian restaurants in Seattle, this gem, just a stone's throw from Pike Place Market, is often overlooked and under-rated.
La Fontana Siciliana is a great example of understated elegance, from cooking to serving to the atmosphere of the place itself. Here you'll find true Old World Italian cuisine served by an impeccable waitstaff in a place with warm ambiance that is both comforting and elevating at the same time.
Pasta dishes are excellent, as are their entrees. Some highlights: Fettucine ai Funghi, Fettucini del Bosco, Pasta con le Sarde, and Pollo Marsala. Their risottos are also excellent.
La Fontana Siciliana is ideal for romantic casual dining, spending quality time with good friends, or before/after a concert or movie close by. Highly recommended for the cuisine, the service, and the atmosphere.","Hope H.","Incredible experience. It seems this is one of the only more traditional Italian restaurants in downtown Seattle, which as a visitor without a car, I didn't want to go outside downtown. The atmosphere was romantic and wonderful. It's a small little restaurant so I'd imagine you'll need a reservation on a Friday and Saturday night. We had the soup of the day, a butternut squash bisque, and the garlic bread to start. The soup was to die for and was topped off with a great parmesan cheese and olive oil. Wonderful pairings. The garlic bread was delicious and great for dipping into the soup. We ordered veal and two pastas for our entrees and not a single plate had anything left on it after. Highly recommend the veal cannelloni which was the star of the night. Portions are of good size, so good that we couldn't even consider desert as we were full with delicious italian carbs.","CAScuba Y.","Rainy Monday nite, wander around per Yelp 4* recommendation. The place indeed felt like in Italy with the gentlemen talking loudly and singing around the room. Don't change a thing, it's awesome! Had a couple glass of delicious Scilian red accompanied by squid ink scallops risotto. There was a hint of sour in the pallet, could be the lemon or something, overall it was fantastic. Great homy Italian"
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Viraj H.","Beautiful place with great food and execution! Cantinetta is a charming little place in Wallingford, which has managed to keep its character over the years.
Went here on a Saturday evening, and thoroughly enjoyed our experience, everything from the decor to service to the food.
The restaurant is beautifully designed, and gives a classy vibe. The ambiance is dark, but could get a little noisy on busy weekend nights.However, it's a perfect place for an intimate date night!
Though the place is pretty large, its popularity keeps it pretty packed, and I wouldn't recommend heading there on weekends without reservations. When we went, every seat was occupied, with more diners waiting to be seated.
Our group got a good variety of food, almost all of which was great. The arancini appetizer was perfectly made, and the focaccia was the best!
Among the pastas, we were blown away by the risotto, but I felt that the tagliatelle was very heavily salted, and didn't enjoy it as much as the other food.
The zeppole was really well made as well, a perfect way to end a meal.
They also have an amazing wine list, and we split a few bottles, all of which were great.
The service was pretty good too. It did get a little slow but with a packed house, that is expected. Our server kept checking on us pretty often, and they had a few other people refilling beverages which helped.
The prices are as expected for a place of this caliber, a little higher than the neighborhood pasta-place. But with the quality of food and service without the pretentiousness, it's completely justifiable.
This is a must go place in Seattle, especially for celebratory night outs or simply date nights. Definitely recommend!","Nelson F.","I think this was my third time there, but I never wrote a review before now.
We arrived a bit early and sat at the bar and had a cocktail while waiting for our table to be ready. The bartender was very busy, but kept checking on us.
Our reservation time came and went, but the hostess kept us informed about what was going on. (The party before us was just taking their time after dinner) No problem, we weren't in a rush.
We got to our table and were introduced to our server Katie. She was great! Very fun, and knowledgeable about the menu.
I was torn between the cacio e pepe tagliatelle and the truffle risotto, and asked if I could get a half order of each. She said they don't do that, but spoke with the chef and was able to put some truffle on the cacio e cepe. It was actually a really good combination!
For dessert, my wife and I split an order of zeppole. 4 balls of warm, gooey, sugary goodness. Two with pistachio sauce, and two with nutella sauce.
We joked that the zeppole was the only reason we were there, but everything we had was excellent.
Cantinetta is part of our regular restaurant rotation!","Ann V.","Such a cute place!
Our bartender was the best! He asked if we've been here before, and when we said no, it was our first time, he automated listed off recommendations from the dinner menu! We ordered all of his suggestions, and they all exceeded expectations! The pork belly was one of the best I've ever had. The gnocchi was soft and pillowy, so delicious and flavorful!
Definitely recommend if you're in the Wallingford area, and looking for a great Italian restaurant with lots of ambiance and excellent service!","Mary G.","Very good Italian food in Wallingford (though there are also locations in Bellevue and I think Madison Park). I ordered the tagliatelle cacio e pepe as my main dish, and I LOVED the noodles. They were chewy, heavy, fresh. I wish there had been a bit more cacio and a bit more pepe on top of them, but the thin sauce allowed the very high quality noodle to shine through. The egg yolk was great to moisten the noodles, too.
The other star of the show was the focaccia our waiter brought to the table while we were waiting for our salads (literally just greens and a vinaigrette, I would rather save the $9 next time). It was like eating a cloud made out of bread! Marvelous texture, salty enough, and amazing olive oil to dip in.
Extensive wine list featuring wines from both Washington and Italy.
This is a good restaurant to come to for a long dinner with friends you haven't seen in a while. We didn't feel rushed by the staff at all, even when the rest of the restaurant filled up with guests. Our waiter was a little odd, but overall the service was good and unobtrusive. I'd recommend ordering one of their delicious pasta dishes as a main course since the second course options were very limited. And flip to the back page of the menu for a chuckle, you'll be glad you did. :)","D Q.","Cantinetta is that perfect neighborhood restaurant that you wish was one block from your house. Tonight, they celebrated New Year's Eve with a gorgeous Prix Fixe menu...and it was amaaaaazing!","Mary H.","Love this place! We come here often before a concert at the Neptune or something at UW and have been coming for years. I have NEVER EVER been disappointed. The atmosphere is friendly always. Service is impeccable- Ryan is an outstanding waiter. My husband loves a cocktail and has never been disappointed. Now for the food starters such as the clams or burrata or dates are terrific and change with the season. Salads - even the simple mista is flavorful. Pastas always spot on...if it is your first time get the bolognese it will not disappoint.","Candace H.","We had a reservation for a Friday night - at around 6:30, it wasn't full yet and the host let us choose to sit outdoors! :) the host was so warm and friendly and our server was attentive, patient, and fun!
The food was AMAZING. We ordered the...
-Clams: honestly the best clams I've had yet. They were all opened, and flavor was fantastic! They give you a generous amount too!
-Focaccia: so soft and they also give you a generous amount. This came around the same time as the clams so dipping it in the sauce/juices was perfection. Really had to work to not get too full before everything else
-Bolognese: flavor was bomb! They use homemade flat wide pasta noodles - to me their pasta seemed to be on the eggier and al dente side. I LOVE wide noodles though!
-Steak: wow perfect medium rare, flavor was spot on, chew was great! Their fingerling potatoes were so cute, they had 3 halves of potatoes that were each a different shade of potato and it looked like a gradient.
Drinks were delicious and sitting outside under the shades was definitely a wonderful experience. Their indoors look so cozy as well! Food was amazing and so was their service. Definitely would come back again to try more foods!","Dennis D.","Bon-jor-no. Find it in a primarily residential area of Wallingford. It has a intimate and rustic ambience about it- candles and low lighting with some music in the background sets the mood.
I'm not well-versed with Italian food, so the menu had a lot of items and words that weren't familiar to me. The prices are fair- for being a more upscale Italian restaurant, they seem to be expected. I had the Osso Buco- veal shank. It's tender and delicious, over a light sauce to give it more herbal taste. Also the polenta complements it well too. And, the Pappardelle alla Bolognese is a nice pasta dish. The texture has a nice bouncey chewy texture.
I came away impressed. Service is on point and was thorough in explaining the menu in comprehendible words. Fine Italian cuisine paired with wine is always a winning combination.","Audrey C.","We went to Cantinetta on recommendation from a coworker and had a great experience! We ordered the burrata, pork belly, focaccia, tagliatelle cacio e pepe, butternut squash agnolotti, and short ribs- all of which we enjoyed. The highlights of the meal were probably the burrata and agnolotti. The focaccia is also a must try.
Sadly, we were so excited about the pasta we forgot to take a picture of the agnolotti entirely.
Overall, we really enjoyed all of the food and will probably be back!","Brittani S.","I came here with my family post graduation. We sat in an area where there was a fan right behind us and it was a little awkward, didn't know whether or we should have turned it off or leave it on. Bread was fresh and soft. Ordered lots of the appetizers. The clams were yummy and the broth that it was served in, absolutely delicious!! I even dipped the bread into it. The bolognese was decent. Dishes are more on the pricier side but it is expected.","Kelsey H.","With so much ""Italian"" in Seattle lately it's sometimes hard to figure out the gems from the rocks. But Cantinetta is differently a gem. Fresh ingredients, ever changing menus, phenomenal service. Fair prices.
We chose to sit outside, which got a little chilly- but they have heaters! Only complaint was the chairs on the patio are not very sturdy.
The focaccia is different than most others I've had, it's so dense and also very addicting. Both pastas were al dente and creative and decent portions. We shared the special Copper River Salmon, and now I get the hype. Served over a succotash of sorts. We loved this dish. No room for dessert- but hoping to be back soon.
Follow @theseafoodies","Mattea D.","Valid average rating yelpers (4 stars). Had a reservation for 5:30 tonight. Street parking but not hard to find, got seated right away.
Menu is straight Italian, I think it varies? Waited awhile to get the server back at the table to order. We got the burrata, baby beets, pane (focaccia) and for mains, rissoto and pappardelle.
The server was pretty helpful and advised us not to over order when we inquired about portion sizes. Helpful, if not overly attentive.
The burrata was ok, tomato and burrata with olive oil and some salt and pepper and micro green garnish. My friend wished it had some basil or pepper or something to add a bit more to it. The tomato looked a little rough.
The baby beets (ricotta, pickled huckleberry, red and yellow beets with olive oil) was great. I loved it, and I normally don't go crazy for ricotta.
We waited a bit for the bread. It was pretty good, a little crumbly, definitely fresh. Olive oil for dipping was delicious.
After a wait the risotto came and it was a bit of a disappointment (risotto, chanterelles, truffle, chicken stock or something?) It tasted a little like fancy rice a Roni plus chanterelles and truffle at the end. The pappardelle was good - friend really liked it. I'm into a bit more sauce myself, but the flavor was on point.
All in all, I would definitely come back but I'm not in a hurry. I thought the hangar steak and the market fish (halibut) sounded amazing.","Brian L.","We came here for restaurant week back in November. The homemade bread they serve is awesome and is dense and flavorful. For our mains we had Cacio e Pepe (which I'm sad to say tasted was more like fettuccine Alfredo with black pepper) and the sausage and gnocchi (which was good!). The star of the meal was the Panna Cotta (dessert). Not a dish I would think I'd ever get all that excited about but holy moly was it good. I'll be going back some day just to eat it again.","Geoff P.","About three bites into our two entrees, I turned to my date and said: ""This could be the best Italian in Seattle."" By the end of the meal, after I ordered another (second) pappardelle to share, I was convinced this is the best Italian in Seattle. We had a bottle of Barbera, which was also divine. The one weakness, if any, was the appetizers. The dates wrapped in pancetta were divine, however.
The highlight was the pappardelle, no doubt. Show-stopping. I'll be back to have it again. Probably within the week. Outstanding food, great service (they were busy), and a great atmosphere for groups of 2-4.
Overall 4.8/5 with the lack of versatility among appetizers as the only weakness.","Sarah K.","I have to say I was very disappointed by this place. There is SO much good pasta in Seattle, but sadly not here. I had the gnocchi and was very disappointed. The clams were delicious.","Amanda K.","I took my boyfriend here for a dinner date after he had a really long week at work. I had been wanting to try this place for a while, but never got around to it. One thing to know about this place is it's literally located in a neighborhood, so do not be fooled when looking for it.
I quite like the decor at Cantinetta. It's rather rustic, and perfect for a night out. The servers are extremely friendly. It was a little busy, despite it being around 5:30. The bread is soft, and served with a fragrant olive oil.
Alex chose a flank steak for dinner, while I went with a black pepper tagliatelle. Alex's steak was resemblant of carne asade, and was served with (according to him) a yummy blackberry jam and fingerling potatoes. My pasta was tossed in a cream sauce with pork cheek, peavines, then topped with an egg yolk. Personally, I thought my pasta was a bit salty for me, but with the bread, it was fine. I absolutely adored the pork cheek because I am a big fan of pork belly. The peavines were a nice addition to the pasta. The pasta was cooked nicely, but I would've preferred maybe a little bit more al dente. Alex seemed to enjoy his steak, and said he would come back again for it (he's picky about steak).
Definitely check this place out!","Marie B.","I revisited Cantinetta - Seattle for the third week of Seattle Restaurant Week this evening 10/29/17. I had visited preYelp days twice before - once sat outdoors with the college friend, second visit was with the fam in the main dining area. It had been years though between visits. Seattle has quite a large assortment of Italian restaurants to choose from!
I just dropped off a family member up for a Halloween event way up north, but it being a Sunday early evening had no issues on I-5 Southbound and arrived at my Wallingford destination way too early for my 7pm reservation. So I sat in my car going through texts and debated whether to check out Union Saloon at the corner....nah, I decided to see if I could be seated 45 minutes earlier. Not a problem with the hostess and I seated myself on the far right of the bar counter.
Holy lord, what an amazingly hot and handsome, personable bartender! Dealt with all the beverages, orders, and checking in with all of us at the wrap around counter with finesse. This was a nice diversion since the rest of the bar counter were a smattering of solo (like myself) and pairs of diners.
I even had to smirk when the woman to my left asked if the arancini contained potatoes. The H&H bartender replied it was rice. I only knew this early on due to Mario Batali's early days on the Food Network, a particular episode of Montalbano on cable, and the killer arancini at Bar del Corso on Beacon Hill, I digress.
And those six chatty women to my right waiting for their table. Initially, it was like dining on an airplane stuck in the middle seat, but with incredible food. I was the unobtrusive diner, but *wow* this was a dinner that was totally on point with quantity and quality. I was so busy earlier today, that I forgot lunch so this meal was perfect.
I had a Bedford's Ginger Beer (local from Port Angeles) with a slice of lime and an iced water, none of that stupid tepid water crap served at other establishments. I was kept hydrated.
Starter: Lopez Island Clams with Nduja Sausage, shallots, and white wine - delicious, succulent, and the broth begged for some artisan bread to dunk. Thank goodness for a big spoon!
Main: Papparadelle alla Bolognese....tender homemade pasta and meaty sauce with a bit of a kick. I ate only half and boxed the rest, because I needed to save room for dessert. Most likely this will be The Homie's lunch for school tomorrow.
Surprise item: The kind hostess gave me a free espresso demi-tasse. This was perfect to cut any potential sweetness from the final dessert course.
Dessert: Zeppole - a pair of freshly fried dough and coated with ginger sugar, with dollops of Nutella and mascarpone. Delish with the espresso!
Big splurge for a solo dinner, but following orders from my sennin-so practitioner to be indulgent and do more things that makes me happy. And yes, this was a great dining experience from start to finish. Make sure to keep Cantinetta on your culinary radar screen! Excellent SRW selections!","Sal K.","Really nice little Italian spot in Wallingford with a nice ambience for a dinner date or just casual dining. Our service was very good and our food was great too! IIRC they have a decent selection of Italian and Washington-area wines.
I will echo the other reviews that say the focaccia here is abnormally dense but somehow really good. Note that you have to order it explicitly -- it's not complementary like some other Italian places, but well worth it. Our appetizer salads were also great!","Theresa Rose P.","In town for family medical appointments. Was looking for a cozy relaxing dinner. Very impressed with the homey service and impeccable Italian flavor. Great wine selection, unique cocktails and rotating local craft beer on tap.
If you are looking for a candlelight dinner for date night, this would be a great option. Just plan to round the block a few times to park. Or take an uber. All around wonderful experience!","Davinah S.","Fantastic wine selection, attentive staff, and creative menu.
My friend and I had a lovely night of dining here! We ordered the arugula salad, which was fresh and layered with lovely flavors. Then we had the clams, which were perfect. She ordered the ravioli and I ordered the carbonara. We were very happy with our choices!"
"Rione XIII","https://www.yelp.com/biz/rione-xiii-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Diana C.","Russel was my bartender the last two nights I was here and he made me some pretty delicious drinks and provided me with really great food. He asked me how my food was the last time I was there and even made sure to speak with the kitchen that night to ensure the dish I wanted was spot on. I was really impressed with his level of customer service and the delicious drinks he whips up!
I am taking away one star because the consistency of the meals is not what it should be for a 5 star spot. Definitely a place I'll come back to though. Thanks Russel!","Elizabeth S.","Updating my review -- last time I was there was several years ago, so things can change. But I am sadly taking away a star from Rione.
I remember in my last review raving about the bread -- of which there was none this time around. Our pasta was... fine. I once again got the Cacio e Pepe, remembering how good it was from a few years ago, and it was, again... fine, as well as the artichoke appetizer, also fine. It was VERY salty -- so if consuming salt is an issue, this isn't the appetizer for you.
I am sure there can be off nights for places, and so this evening was that for us. Our server was very nice, and I do think I'll visit again when I'm in Seattle. Four stars is still a really good rating -- but I can't maintain the 5-er I gave them before.","Mia Z.","Just had dinner here for seattle restaurant week. Another Ethan Stowell restaurant. It is solid. Good appetizers and both pasta entrees are so so so good.
I personally probably won't come back here again though as my fav Ethan Stowell restaurant stays Staple & Fancy in Ballard.","Joshua L.","I love this place for happy hour, but have had good experiences just eating dinner here. They take reservations which is nice so definitely reserve a table online if you can plan ahead.
It's a really nice spot on 15th Ave E in Capitol Hill which is really one of my favorite little areas in Seattle. It feels like the perfect mix of neighborhood and city and this place is exactly that!
Some of the things I especially like from HH are the Fried Gnocchi, the buratta, there was a tripe dish and a buccatini I really liked. Sorry if that's not that helpful.
Parking in the area is pretty manageable and the service is really great. Definitely try this place for a nice happy hour or a fancy dinner!","Carolyn J.","The food is really crazy good here! They could get really crowded , so make a reservation. Our server is very attentive and very knowledgeable with the menu.
He recommended a Spelt wine and we were pleased. The food, oh lord. The butter with the focaccia was amazing! Soft, creamy, rosemary, with some bee pollen thing. The pastas were sooo good. Wow! We ended our meal with a sorbetto. We were very satisfied. Cant wait to go back!","Vickerie W.","We love the other Ethan restaurants and this was no exception. The gnocchis will be my last meal. Period. However we branched out and also had the americana dish -that sauce on the bucatini...!!!! I immediately bought the ccookbook with the hope the recipe was in there-nope. It's a complex, dark, red spicy tomato sauce and I will absolutely crave it! I scooped some extra sauce onto the gnocchi-it's so good. One of the only places in the city with Gnocchi a la romana (semolina not potato) and you're mIssing out if you haven't tried it. I am so full from ordering way too much and already looking forward to going back.","Ashley F.","Server Chris was super cool; ended up giving us out of towners some great recommendations! Food was prompt, delicious and affordable! We did the $40/person préfixe option. 7 dishes, 4 courses, we chose pescatarian - squash soup starter, salad, pear & goat cheese toast, roasted cauliflower, a mushroom & cheese pasta, fresh mozzarella, a while halibut & an amazing coconut-like sorbet to finish. I'd def go back if I'm in town.","Camille J.","My boyfriend and I stopped here for a late dinner and were pleased to find that their kitchen was still open at 10pm. We got the chicken liver mousse bruschetta to start and shared the bucatini and fennel sausage pizza. He got a whiskey sour with egg whites (extra $2, though he thought it was worth it to take the drink from $9 to a reasonable $11), and I got the Sicilian bramble, which was just a delightfully refreshing drink. Nice and fruity but not fake tasting - an ideal balance.
I loved the bruschetta. First of all, it was served with 4 large pieces of fluffy bread. The bread was perfectly done - crisp crust that wasn't so hard it would cut the roof of your mouth and soft inside. I usually expect some measly little crostinis or small pieces of baguette at nicer places like this. To match the thickness of the bread, there was a thick layer of mousse on top as well, making this actually quite a large and filling dish.
The bucatini was a little too al dente for our taste, and I typically enjoy my pasta al dente. Just maybe a wee bit less al dente. The sauce was good though, albeit a little salty, especially considering how salty guanciale already is. When we finished the pasta, the waitress suggested that we keep the leftover sauce to dip the pizza crust in, and my mind was blown. I feel like it's usually the opposite situation - where I want to keep the sauce on the plate but it's swept away before I can say anything.
The pizza was also a hefty serving. The sausage wasn't too salty and was very tasty. The crust was a little soft, but overall the pizza was delicious. We were both very happy with the meal, the service, and the restaurant overall. They also had a great playlist going on.","Audrey C.","We went here the other week for SRW and had a great experience. All of the food was really good and I love the fact that they have 5 appetizers to split so you can get to try more of the menu.","Bonnie G.","I picked this place for a birthday celebration - easier to justify all the carbs! The fried polenta gnocchi (my fav dish), the fried risotto with ragu, the two pastas, and the two pizzas we tried were all worth the splurge. Everything was well seasoned and perfectly prepared. We also tried the fresh beans with ricotta and pistachios, and fried artichokes - both were delicious. The salad was a large serving of very fresh greens. Even with all that, we also ordered a dessert to share. I can't stop talking about the warm pumpkin cake with spiced pecans, sauce and ice-cream. We all went nuts. And it was large enough for all five of us to have a couple of bites each - all we could manage considering the feast we just consumed. The service was as good as the food. What a fun and delicious meal.","Christine E.","I am hesitant to write this review because I want to keep this happy hour to myself :) one of the best happy hours on the hill. They recently changed it from 4-6pm. They offer $20 bottles of wine, tons of items from their menu and a lot of really great options for HH. All of the food is delicious, especially the polenta, Cacio e pepe and the burrata!","Tara L.","Delicious food and wine! My friend and I wished our appetites were bigger so we could enjoy more of the delicious food! Dim mood lighting and soft noise level made for a very ambient and warm experience. Gabe is the best!!!","Lakshmi B.","Come here almost weekly with the kids for pizza. Have tried almost the entire menu. The burrata changes seasonally and is always delicious. Stand out pasta is the Cacio e Pepe. My absolute favorite dish is the whole branzino. Always cooked and seasoned perfectly. Highly recommend.","Michael C.","Went to Rione XIII as part of a group of 5. The service was amazing. The food was amazing. Our server was one of the best I've ever had, very attentive. All 5 in my group were ecstatic over the quality and taste of the food. Apps, pastas and pizza were all top notch. Will defiantly be going back!!","Tiffany J.","Happy hour here is well worth the money. Can sit at the bar and do work while you eat. Cacio e pepe is okay. Go to is the Amatriciana for sure. Happy hour portion is slightly small but filling. If you get the regular order, definitely split it with someone else. Not spicy at all !","Zhexiao C.","Is this the portion size and presentation for 22 dollars and 18 dollars? This is what I got from Uber eats","Christian A.","Another great Italian/pasta place! Went on a Monday evening and was immediately seated. We got the fried artichokes as an appetizer. It was solid and the aioli was pretty good. For the main dishes we got the hot coops pizza and the carbonara. The pizza was wood fire and delicious. The toppings went well together and it was a good size for one hungry person or two to share. The carbonara was excellent and a huge portion. The pasta was cooked al dente and the egg yolk on top made it even creamier and elevated the texture. It definitely could have used a little bit more salt or seasoning, but it was still delicious. The service is great and our waitress was very friendly and nice. Will definitely be returning and will be part of our Italian/pasta rotation.","Dana R.","Over the past few years, the food and service at this place has declined significantly, which makes me sad as I used to frequent quite often.
Went last night for the first time in about a year (after tossing in the towel) with some friends who suggested it ... we hoped that things had improved. Nope.
After waiting at our table for more than 10 minutes, we finally asked a passing employee whether we had a server and she my goodness has he not been by ... nope. She then at that moment kindly took our drink and appetizer order.
Our server showed up with the wine and made no apology or any acknowledgment that he left us hanging for so long at the outset. He then proceeded to be snarky throughout service.
Wine was fine. Artichokes were over salted and had very little pangratto. The fried risotto with beef ragu and mozzarella was good.
The winter squash ravioli downright bad and was sent back ... predominantly muddy flour water taste ... bizarre for a dish of the type I order frequently.
Both the carbonara and cacio et pepe pastas lacked flavor and tasted watered down. The guanciale in carbonara was chewy, bloated and unrendered.
The Amatriciana pasta was good after a friend doctored it up with her own calabrian chili oil for more flavor.
Ordered baguette with olive oil after an extended discussion with server about whether we wanted focaccia ... focaccia arrived anyway ... didn't see the bill but we indicated we didn't want it and they told us to keep it anyway ... too much honey in the butter according a friend who tried it.
Much better Italian in the area ...","Taylor D.","Went to Rione several years back so decided it was time to try it again for SRW this fall. My girlfriend and I had a great time, loved the food and the menu options for SRW were great. The service was a bit slow toward the end and we asked for our food to go but must have been misheard because they threw it out. Regardless I'd definitely go back.","Mia C.","This little restaurant/bar is absolutely adorable. I came in for happy hour on Sunday and did a glass of the house red, fresh mozzarella with grilled bread, and radishes with butter.
I love that their menu has a wide variety of fresh, fried, grilled, and everything in between. Many things on the menu i had never heard of, such as fried gnocchi --i love finding new things! I did not get any of the pastas or pizzas this time, but will definitely be back to try both with friends, as one serving of either is quite large!
The staff is very friendly, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. At the tables were large families, couples on dates, friends. There were also some individual people at the bar just reading, and I love a place where I can feel comfortable just to come alone if I want. I also loved the painted pink flowers in the restroom and the painting of cakes, yum! Thank you Ethan Stowell, for another restaurant to add to my happy hour and dinner list :)
The total bill for me was about $20+tax+20%service charge."
"Vito’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vitos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","ben s.","Gotta love a dark bar with some flavor and class. Good food, nice people working here.
I really appreciate the support of live music, combined with good food and a well-tended bar, so I'd send friends here anytime.
I know I'm goin back.","Kenneth S.","Pricey drinks, bad bar service, indifferent staff.
Vitos has great atmosphere, but the service is slow and not attentive.
I was at the bar, where service is normally good anywhere, but ended up being ignored, dry, and wondering if I was invisible.
When I tried to talk to a manager, the staff seemed confused and finally said one was not on duty.","Odulami B.","This venue was suggested by some friends while we were visiting Seattle. I was not impressed by their website nor did the locale raise my expectations. I was pleasantly surprised when we entered the establishment by the infectious atmosphere we experienced. I pictured Vito's as a place The Godfather was filmed and I think he would have been proud to dine here. As luck would have it there was a great cover band playing which livened they dark ambiance. A few couples took to the small dance floor which was fun to watch. It was too loud for long conversations but we were quickly silenced by an array of deliciousness. I would definitely suggest the lasagna or the Farfalle Diavolo (if you like a little spice). Our favorite appetizer was the Gamberoni & Polenta. This is a great place for a small group or intimate encounter.","Michele M.","We spent the evening in December celebrating a big birthday with a group of 8.
I reserved a table in advance. Dinner was delicious and this review is about the SERVICE.....because it was SUBPAR. Our waitress, named Stephanie was unfriendly, lacked customer service skills or even normal people skills and just seemed to be annoyed or just didn't want to be there....
Our table is a friendly, happy group...not demanding or mean and we all have a lot of grace when it comes to others.
Her attitude made several of my guests uncomfortable and her lack of service was obvious to everyone because it was discussed later.
Our bill for our dinner was SUBSTANTIAL and we left a very gracious tip...even with the poor service, which honestly I should have reevaluated the amount we left.
I know that when I go out for a meal I want great service..that's why we go out...for the experience and I don't want to cook! I expect to feel good at the end of the meal on all accounts.
I did reach out to the management and finally received a reply, which was subpar as well...I'm disappointed and probably won't go back, which saddens me because it's an iconic Seattle place.","Thao N.","So romantic! Wonderful artists with no cover charge. A great chance to see local artists and enjoy great Italian cuisine. Happy hour has such good deals! The spaghetti is a good size portion and only $4 during happy hour. Pay an additional $2 for a meatball. The tiramisu is divine! Dimly lit with leather couches for a comfy, sexy date. I greatly enjoyed eating my garlic bread while enjoying relaxing piano smooth jazz. Highly recommended date venue.","Kentucky S.","What a great place! Great music, great food, great booze selection. Too bad they had a subpar bartender working! The table service was exceptional and the patrons we talked to were a treat. We had zero issues until we moved to the bar. Actually there were two bartenders; one was great, the other one was an ass. She was rude and loudly talking about a couple patrons that we saw to be very nice. I'm not sure if they didn't tip enough, or if they were just the wrong color? To be clear since we didn't catch her name, she was the bartender with the palest skin white sleeveless blouse and the most tattoos. Given the fact we had the best long weekend in Seattle that we could hope for, we had to overlook this person and her terrible attitude, or else she would have ruined our entire trip. I'm sincerely hoping her boss sends her to diversity and inclusion training , or else fires her and hopes she learns to be a better person in the future. Truly, this would be a 5 Star rating if we hadn't moved from our table to the bar. But witnessing this person's hateful attitude towards and older biracial couple literally turned our stomachs!","J W.","I've been here now several times and I just love this place. The atmosphere is awesome, the food is delicious and the service has been amazing. We are even thinking of having our wedding reception here. I can't speak highly enough. Love it.","Jessee L.","Vito's was absolutely amazing! The food was fantastic. Prices were great. Wine selection was great as well, as I shared a nice bottle of Cabernet with fellow work associates. We came on a might with some jazzy group singing Christmas carols. It really was a fantastic evening.","Brian S.","Great Club to Listen to Live Music and this type of place is a dying breed of a night club.","Justin C.","I highly recommend taking a group of friends or a date here. Vito's is filled with character and characters, live music, good food, and it is the living volatile definition of the word 'nightlife'. Easily a one-stop spot for the whole night out- music started for us around 9:20pm and went on into the night, I think we left after midnight, hard to keep track of time but once you're inside it's easy to just let go and enjoy the space and people here. Thanks to the wait staff, kitchen wizards, fast bartenders and jazz musicians (The Michael Owcharuk Ensemble whose GOT rendition at the end was insane) that made our Friday so enjoyable. Looking forward to next time V.","Mira P.","When the moon hits you eye like a big pizza pie
That's amore.....When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine
That's amore
That's amore
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling.
This was the song that was in my head the whole time during our visit to Vito's. I was excited that they offered live music and have 2 different varieties of musicians (1st one was Italian music focused and the other band that performed at 9pm was more New Orleans Jazz style).
It was a Saturday night we ventured out here, Note* we called to make reservations but they were booked however, the bar area is first come first serve so we took a shot and went anyways. If you want a table- make a reservation.
The venue is fairly small so I can see how the tables fill up fast. We sat at the bar, bonus they had happy hour until 7pm on a Saturday. Love my happy hour specials and even more when they offer it everyday of the week.
We ordered the following off the happy hour menu:
prosecco and red wine $ 5 each
Vito's Sliders (2)** they were delicious
We also ordered the Farfalle Diavolo $18
(sausage, prawns, spicy vodka cream sauce) I modified it to try to keep it clean as possible.
The ambience is what really made our visit unforgettable, the ""Italian band"" really sounded German to me but it was just a different old school vibe, I was digging it. Plus the red leather couches, mirrors and disco ball.. just picture yourself back in the days.. I bet there are stories. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to locals and visitors. After all, its amore...","Savannah B.","This place is a most lovely speakeasy. The food is great and the entertainment jives with the overall New York/Italian theme they have going. It's very dimly lit for an intimate dining experience. There's a private room in the back called The Cougar Room which can be booked for parties. The bartenders are knowledgeable and no nonsense. They always have vegetarian options. Last night I enjoyed the bruchetta, and a Caesar salad which was perfectly wilted - half a romaine head just the way I like it with a lemon wedge on the side. I sampled the main pasta dish without the tuna, which had some nice flavor profiles. They cycle through specials, so be sure to check what's available when you're there.","Victor L.","Rude and un-attentive staff. Went to pickup pizza to bring to the hospital after a long day and was told we cant have a glass of water while we wait for the food as it was a pick up order. what kind of stupid policy is that? Once we finally got the food the ""chicken ceasar salad"" was literally a piece of lettuce with cheese sprinkled on (no chicken, dressing, flavor etc) The pizzas were also disgusting. What a TERRIBLE restaurant. I would never in a million years recommend this garbage place to anyone.","Rekha B.","This place is a gem. Romantic atmosphere, live but not-too-loud music, friendly service, and tasty, not overpriced food. One star off for a slightly limited selection of cocktails and the seats that are blocked from seeing the music.","Jaclyn F.","I took some friends visiting from Vancouver, BC to Vito's since there's nothing like it there for Italian food plus live music. Everything was top notch from the attentive service to the amazing food and great live entertainment. I had the lasagna (delicious),cannoli and we shared a couple bottles of red wine. Our table was right near the bands, as per requested. We were late arriving due to our Uber driver so I called the restaurant and let them know. They were totally accommodating, even for a very busy Saturday evening where this particular table would be snapped up in a second. We had a blast and my friends loved the experience. I'll be recommending this place to any out of town guests as well as any locals who haven't been. A perfect choice for a date night, or classy night out with good friends!","Alina H.","Such a good place for Italian food! Immediately when you walk in, you get this old school Italian vibe. My bf took me here for dinner, which has a nice romantic atmosphere with the dim lights. I came around 5:30, before the dinner rush so it was pretty empty. This review is just for their happy hour menu. We got the garlic bread, lounge spaghetti and meatball, and sausage pizza. Everything tasted great and I felt like I was getting a good value for the price. Nothing too special however since only the basic items were offered on HH. I would love to come back to try their specialty dishes.","Thomas C.","The exterior doesn't give a fair indication of the fabulous meal that awaits inside.
Absolutely the BEST pork chop and mashed potatoes that I have ever eaten.
My wife had the chicken parmigiana with pasta which was also perfectly tasty.
Ambiance harkens back to a finer time with a pianist playing some old-time classics.","Richard C.","Spicy sausage pasta was so hot, I had to send it back. Ended up with a chicken pasta that was wonderful. This is an unusual place, it's straight out of 1962.
I don't think you'll find a restaurant in Seattle that is darker lit than Vito's. Having said all that, the bathrooms were updated and the overall experience was just fine.","Olga A.","Portions definitely stand to be larger :) After ordering $25 worth of food in the lounge ($30 with tip), I was still a bit hungry - and I usually don't finish a plate. Food took some time but the bartender was prompt. Both charcuterie and pasta had plenty of seasoning. A bit too much spice and garlic. But that's a matter of preference and not a lack of food quality.
Nice ambiance, open late. Would like to check out their live music one night.","Constance M.","Just great Italian comfort food, dark, lounge feel and a long list of good cocktails with live jazz bands. Can't go wrong."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cassidy G.","We've been twice now and absolutely love everything at Raccolto. Even with a reservation you may find yourself having to wait for a bit as it's a small space and they're always busy, but it's definitely worth the wait. Both times we've come we've ended up getting seats at the bar and having a cocktail while we wait for a table and the drink menu is always fresh, creative and delicious.
We got the steak tartare both times because it's that good; don't skip it, just order it and be happy.
This place does all fresh pastas and damn, they are delicious and noticeably better than anything you were planning on making at home instead. Could go on and on but just know this: everything we've had here is worth the cost, the wait, and more.
Finally, excellent service both trips in seal the deal. Our server last time in was so knowledgeable, friendly, nice to chat with and even comped our drinks for no apparent reason other than maybe because we had to wait a bit for our table. We love it here and will definitely be back again and again.","Michelle D.","I'm a fan. The small shareable plates at Raccolto are excellent. I have literally enjoyed every single thing I have ever tried here. And that says a lot, because I don't like a lot. The cavatelli pasta ... yes, please. Always a must-have. The service is knowledgeable and warm without being intrusive. The location on California Ave in West Seattle has given our neighborhood it's first real contemporary Italian option. Helpful note before you go: The restaurant itself is small. There is a counter bar in the back I have sat at once, but otherwise always been seated in the main space and it's just not big and not cozy or warm. More like open and bright. Make a reservation on Open Table or call ahead. Most of the time you don't need to do that in WS, but here you should and you will get right in.
Now the negative. Despite liking the food and all, I'm giving them 3 stars for two reasons: 1) a couple years ago I wanted to have my office holiday dinner here. Tried to set it up way in advance. They were SUPER rude and dismissive. That alone kept me away for almost a year. 2) Came by once with friends when there were tons of tables open and they were weird and wouldn't seat us, saying they were booked. That's fine, but major attitude. We went and ate down the street and walked by to the cars two hours later and the same tables were open ... they didn't turn over. After these two incidents I almost never wanted to come back. But after some time I did. And it's good. I still won't be a regular given the above, but at one point I would have written a one star review (after someone was a massive jerk when all I wanted to do was spend thousands of dollars for a dinner party and rent out the whole place) and swore I would NEVER go back ... so the theme of this review should be ""forgiveness"" and a hard-earned three stars that is a testament to the great food.","Bree S.","We came here a few months ago and it was 5 star perfection. The brussel sprouts, the burratta, the chicken. Amazing. This time was disappointing, but for the amazing pasta, which is worth the trip, despite the missteps.
There were serious timing issues that ruined the flow of the evening.
We made the mistake of going ahead and ordering food before drinks arrived. We waited over 20 minutes for drinks. Appetizers came before the drinks and were piled onto the table before the drinks even came. Then we waited an hour for the rest of the food.
The chicken was NOT the chicken we had the last time we were here. It was fatty and very salty. A lot of waste.
The cocktails were stirred in dirty shakers. There were multiple flavors in the drinks and when it was brought to the attention of staff, they were defensive and refused to mix a new drink, clinging to the claim that we didn't know what we were tasting. The waiter served the drinks with his fingers all over the rims of the glasses. He carried the drink in dispute back and forth from our table to the bar 3 times. No apologies or offers to mix a fresh drink in a clean shaker. It was awkward and instead of refusing the drink, we just relented. So disappointing. Instead of insisting on being right, why not just mix your clients a clean drink?
We loved this place when we came in October. Perfect timing. Very low key gracious service.
Don't know if it was an off night or if this is what to expect going forward.
Don't like to express disappointment in my own neighborhood, but for the premium prices we should expect premium service and quality of food.
Show less","Teresa J.","Finally made it here to celebrate my husband's birthday tonight and left feeling unsatisfied + I couldn't drink enough water to offset the amount of salt in our food.
We started off with bread and Brussel sprouts - the first bite was good but after that all we could taste was salt.
After waiting for awhile (and watching a larger group that came in well after us get their food before us) our two pasta dishes finally arrived with apologies for taking so long. The rigatoni was topped with pork and kale - I guess I didn't expect to see salty pork carnitas on top of a bed of over oiled/buttered noodles.
Pesto bucatini lacked flavor outside of the flick of the wrist of salt that was on every.single.thing.
Spent $100 (only one beer in the mix). Would have been fine if it was worth it, but so frustrating when it's not.","Janet N.","I dined here during restaurant week and did not have a good experience. I've had Raccolto bookmarked for awhile and was really excited to try the food. The restaurant is really nice and is aesthetically pleasing. However, I wasn't a fan of the fact that by the time I left the restaurant my clothes had reeked of their cooking.
The food was okay for the most part. I liked that the appetizers course had about 4 different plates to share at your table. I got to try a little bit of everything that they offered. My main was the halibut and it wasn't very memorable.. The plating was fairly sloppy. I can tell that they were rushing to make my plate.
The service was not good. Our server was initially pleasant, but I noticed a shift in her attitude and pace after I declined to opt into the wine pairings. A couple who also shared the same server as us arrived later than we did and received their appetizers and mains before we did.. We found that odd as everyone in the restaurant that day was essentially receiving the same meal. I just wasn't understanding her logic in serving people who came in about 10 minutes after we did? She never checked in on us and never refilled our water even after we had put the bottle on the edge of the table. Our plates of food were just being plopped on the table and she would vanish to cater to someone else's needs. I'm not sure if it's something we did, but we found the service to be unacceptable.
I think it's pretty obvious that I would never choose to dine here again.","Kristin P.","One of my favorite pasta places in Seattle! The service was awesome and the food was amazing! The ambiance is perfect for date night.","Monica D.","This is currently my favorite restaurant in West Seattle. It is wise to make a reservation but you can get a spot to eat at the bar if you go early.
The carrot soup is amazing and so is the smoked fish piled high on dense chewy grilled bread.
The pastas are always delish and we usually get a seafood recently copper river and the halibut is also great.
The food and wine have been so good in 8-10 visits I have never yet had dessert!","David B.","Hits the spot. Well thought out menu.
Nice staff for the most part. There are a few supercilious members who are confusing West Seattle with the Upper West Side of Manhattan, but the food makes up for it.
5 visits and most everything has been excellent. The pasta is wonderful, the cuts of beef nice and the greens are great.
I don't agree with the Orca-sized chunks for the Crudo. Personal taste, but it is about experiencing the fish and the flavors and not the choke.
Good to have a place for a ""little"" upscale swing on the Island.","Claire S.","We went there last night. I found the staff to be very nice and super efficient. At least the ones I met.
We each ordered pasta dishes, as well as coffee, wine, bread and a nice corn dish.
The problem was the pasta- their specialty. My husband ordered tagliatelle with crab meat. The pasta was cool to the touch; not even lukewarm. The crab meat in it was cold. Not cool- cold. The server couldn't have been nicer. She took the tagliatelle off the bill and comped our Americanos, which I appreciate.
Mine was barely warm enough so I went ahead and had it. Flavors were excellent, good sized portion. However, it sat uneasily in my stomach for a very long time afterward.
This is a gorgeous charming expensive place. They need to get their kitchen in order. Don't worry about seeing us again, because you won't.","T O.","I've been eyeing this place for awhile and finally got the opportunity to go here this evening with family. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice, clean and simple. Here is the run down of the experience:
Appetizers: Down right the best part of the meal. Loved the flavor profile of each of these dishes and I would have been content with just eating this alone.
1) Burrata with olive tapenade and crostini's.
2) Charcuterie - Salami, watercress and a sweet whole grain mustard with crostini's as well.
Pasta: Unfortunately, the pasta had a lot left to be desired.
1) Rigatoni - Braised pork, kale and parmesan. Was really bland and watery.
2) Bucatini - Pesto, tomato and parmesan. Was really bland and watery as well.
3) Strozzapreti - Bolognese and parmesan. Was the best tasting pasta dish of the evening, but lacked a good punch in flavor.
Drinks: We ordered a black manhattan and shared between us. Loved the flavor profile of this drink.
Service: The gals working tonight were attentive and very nice. Unfortunately, our main sever for the evening needs to not assume things. He was really trying hard to make the sales pitch to my family elders and pretty much focused on them. Seriously, treat us all equally, instead of sucking up to the people you assumed were going to be paying the bill. The look on his face when he realized he screwed up when I gave him my credit card to pay the bill was picture worthy. Also, we indicated that this was our first time at this restaurant and I stated I'm a regular at GH Pasta Co, but he spoke to me in minimal words that this place is not the same and much more upscale. Ummm... ok. There was no need for that pretentious vibe.
Overall, I say stick to eating the appetizers and having a drink here. If you want pasta, seriously go to GH Pasta Co. in downtown Seattle. Owned by the same chef and the pastas are fabulous! I'm hungry just thinking of the super flavorful pasta dishes one can get there.
Note - The bar is small and if you want a table you'll need to have a reservation. If you don't have a reservation, look on their online reservation service for availability as there actually might be a table available sooner then what the hostess will indicate to you in person.","Kurt H.","After living in San Francisco and having dined at world class Italian restaurants and around the world, was looking forward to dining here.
To those who say ""this is the best Italian restaurant they've ever been to"", I say you must be a Seattle native. Salt is the prominent taste in every dish.
The steak was fatty, the Halibut was bland. Having to pay for bread and olive oil? How déclassé. Service was good, wine selection mediocre. We brought our own bottle of Napa Howell Mountain Cab. The waitress gave us white wine glasses (right) and never poured one glass for us, even though we paid the corkage fee.
The ambiance is dated by about 2 decades and don't expect to have an intimate conversation because you will hear everyone else's drown out yours.
Go to the Pink Door if you want a fine dining Italian experience with a stellar wine list and seasoned staff.
Thank you, Next.","Claudia L.","Came here for a fun evening with friends. We were all first-timers to Raccolto, so we asked for recommendations from our (excellent) server. The menu is all small plates, and you order and share. What a great way to have a meal! Everything we had was good. I liked some things more than others ... but the roasted chicken and strozzapreti pasta were absolute stand-outs. Very nice selection of wines, too.
This little gem is about a 15-minute Uber from downtown Seattle, and it's very much worth the trip. Definitely make a reservation. You won't be sorry!","Stefan I.","First rate. Took my Mom and we went to town on the menu. Well-prepared and well- presented. Very good taste.
Only real criticism is that the interior is way too ""live"", and thus it can get quite noisy.","Christopher N.","Last night I made spaghetti, and meatballs. The meatballs were handmade, and not to big up myself (#prayerhandemoji), they were on point. The sauce, and pasta were store bought though. I'm not going to shit on Paul Newman (RIP), so his sauce gets a pass. However, the pasta is always the weakest link. There's such a wide gap between dried store bought pasta, and fresh. Its almost like eating two different things, or equivalent to listening to mumble rap, and Gang Starr (RIP Guru). There's really no comparison!
I've been to Raccolto half a dozen times over the years, and its always been superb. From the appetizers, pasta, and proteins, its all done extremely well. The restaurant is also fairly beautiful. Clean, modern, and cozy. Also, the service is top notch, and thoughtful. The staff knows the food well, they give great recommendations, and are overall fantastic.
Tip: They recommend a starter, pasta, and protein. Every time before the last time i went last week I've only gotten a starter, and pasta. The server, who was great, recommended the aforementioned, and also a protein. Like a sucker, I got upsold. It was a lot of food, and after the starter, and pasta I was full, and didn't really have any room for the tasty protein. Go light people. You can always order more if needed. You're welcome.
My favorite two dishes are the Foie Gras Mousse, and Bucatini. I'm a foie gras junky, and order it at any restaurant that has it, or a variant. Raccolta's version is a creamy, rich mousse on bread with a jam of sorts. I'm not smart, but I'd call it honey. Three pieces come with an order, but I can usually only eat one cause its almost too much good. Its a must have if its your initial visit. Although all their pasta's are excellent, I'm partial to the bucatini w/mussels. The pasta is chewy, and cooked perfectly. I've had all their pasta dishes, and haven't been disappointed once, so order with impunity.
Tip 2: Make reservations or you won't get in unless you go in early enough. First time I went it was like 5pm (hey, I'm old, and although I'm not quite a grey hair yet, I like to practice their ways) and I got in. Subsequent times I've made reservations per their request.
I gotta get out to this joint more often cause there's no substitute for fresh pasta. From the food to the service, everything is top notch at Raccolto. The only thing holding me back is the jaunt to get to West Seattle from Burien, and I'll spare you the rant I'm sure ya'll are tired of. You're welcome, and Salute!","Tom K.","This place is the unicorn that keeps getting better instead of compromising their way back into the pack. Very hard not to overeat.","Deb W.","Staff was hot and cold in their attitude which was fascinating to observe with All. Atmosphere got pretentious, oddly. Appetizers were very good in size an flavors, was filling. Ordered a couple pasta dishes of which 2 were flat in flavor and very very watery. Box building so not much to absorb the guests voices hence noise volume makes it's challenging to hear at ones own table. Might try again in 6 months to see if staff games it up.","Claudia L.","I recently came to Raccolto for a birthday dinner based on the raving reviews I found online. It was my first time visiting and I was excited to see what the hype was about. The atmosphere was great, perfect for a large party or an intimate date night. The vibe was industrial chic in a loft setup, very open and welcoming. The cocktails and appetizers were delicious and came out fairly quickly. For my main course, I ordered the tagliatelle with crab, and I have to say I was very disappointed. All I could taste was butter. It had absolutely no flavor at all, and very little crab for an additional $8. Luckily, I tried my boyfriends meal which was the chicken rigatoni, and my sisters which was the halibut and both were flavorful and much better than mine. I am thinking I maybe just selected the wrong entree, but should that even be a thing in a restaurant of this caliper?","Naomi P.","Delicious! We loved it. Super cute atmosphere, amazing wait staff and excellent food. I would definitely recommend. I actually heard mixed reviews, some great and then one person said it was salty, so I thought I'd finally see for myself and it wasn't too salty at all. We had oysters, beets, crab salad, TAGLIATELLE pasta (with lamb, caper, fennel, mascarpone), scallops and finally the chocolate cake which blew my mind! We went for our anniversary and I am so happy with our experience and want to clear up all the mixed reviews enough to actually write a review. I hope this place never leaves, because it's only a few blocks away from us. A +","Jess C.","I ventured to West Seattle to try their delicious looking pastas and foie gras toast; however, I left disappointed. For parties of 5 and more they require a prix fixe, which is a great deal for $60, but I could not select dishes I wanted. The food was disappointing and service was cold and unfriendly.
* Olives, charcuterie - 3 stars: Boring. I enjoyed the buttery bread.
* Tomatoes and melon - 2.5 stars: Zzzzzz boring.
* Cauliflower soup - 4 stars: tiny but delicious and flavorful - one of the highlights!
* Pasta - 3 stars: Light, and not flavorful enough.
* Salad - 1 star: horrible and poorly dressed.
* Salmon - 3.5 stars: Decently tasty but the best part was the tomatoes.
* Chicken - 3.5 stars: Nicely poached, but too salty and the best part was the kale
* Espresso ice cream - 4 stars: The best part of the meal
* Semifreddo - 2 stars: Standard semifreddo, did not like.
* Mocktail - 2 stars: Way too sour, not enjoyable.
Would come back with a smaller party to try some other dishes.","Mihaela V.","Better than sex.
Seriously, the best pasta I've ever had. Better than Italy.
The Cavatelli with just salt, pepper (cacio e pepe) with an added poached egg and parmesan is to die for.
Service is great, too.
Chef Brian makes poetry with pasta."
"Mamma Melina Ristorante + Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mamma-melina-ristorante-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jeff H.","Best Cesar salad ever. Can the one crouton on top magically multiply by 500 because it was that good?
We had a mostly great dinner here tonight which included some well made old fashions from the bar, gnocchi, bucatini, crab linguini, and a Sicilian pizza.
Added the spicy meatballs to the gnocchi dish and that was the best choice of the night because the gnocchi doesn't come with meat and those meatballs tasted perfect.
The pizza was a perfect blend of flavors and the crust was just crispy enough.
The bucatini cane with the smaller meatballs that were not spicy and the sauce was perfect.
The only bummer was the crab linguini which was too salty. Edible, but the crab especially was heavy on salt and it really took away from the flavor even though the sauce was tasty.
Will go back again and maybe the salt will have taken a chill pill. All in all.... recommend!","Diana N.","Meal from last summer - apologizes for the late review.
Here's the scoop:
Changing table in women's bathroom
Toilet seats are warmed, a little unnecessary
Large open seating area
Swarmed with flies due to open windows/walls
Service a little slow
Here's what we ordered:
Spaghetti with clams was outstanding
Substantial amount of crab for 13$ salad
Fried calamari was tasty w/ 2 sauces - one spicy, one tomato based
Grilled ck from kids meal was too charred and overcooked
Seafood pasta with tomato sauce was tasty
Kids penne pasta with meat sauce, butter and cheese was a overpowered with butter
Would I return? Probably not. It's a very popular place with lots of foot traffic from bikers (my group of people). Swing by if you're in the neighborhood and catch happy hour if you can, that's always a bonus.","Gregory P.","""We should go to Mio Posto more often..."" is what my wife said to me as we left Mamma Melina tonight. That and ""we just won't ever go back.""
We have been coming to MM regularly together since 2012, and my wife has been going there since they were on Roosevelt long before that. Tonight was the last straw.
Perhaps they have changed management or been sold or something, but the food and the service have both degraded significantly over the last 18-months or so. The food was once good, and we left satisfied, and would take our leftovers home if there were any. Sadly our favorite dishes which we have ordered consistently are now rarely impressive and sometimes just bad. We often leave saying - wow that place has gone downhill. At least until tonight anyway.
The last time we were at the restaurant, we sat in the bar for happy hour and our waitress berated the bus boy so badly that we felt the need to pull him aside separately and give him a cash tip and tell him we thought he was doing just fine. She blamed the fact that no one had contacted us for 10+ mins on him and trash talked him to us after he gave us water.
Tonight we stopped in for dinner and were sat promptly, nobody contacted us for a solid 10 minutes, and when someone did, they apologized for the wait and took our drink orders. Another 15 mins later they brought our wine and took our dinner orders. Eventually when our food came out we had been sitting at the table for 5 mins shy of an hour and the food was warm (not hot) and my wife's bucatini was AWFUL. The meatballs were legitimately bad. My pizza was acceptable but was not cooked as well as I would have hoped, warm, but mostly undercooked. It took another 10 minutes of waiting before my wife went to the host stand to get our check.
It's unfortunate, but after having eaten there consistently for years, Mamma Melina will no longer be considered when we choose a restaurant to eat dinner or to recommend to friends.","Alejandra V.","GREAT HAPPY HOUR!!! I'm almost nervous that I found such a great happy hour spot because this could definitely mean bad news for my wallet ;-)
Mamma Melina was recommended to me by an avid fan due to their amazing Happy Hour deals (all day Sunday & Monday, what?!) and their delicious Italian food. I have to say, she was right on all fronts, and I'm sold.
A few friends joined me for a celebration of my one-year anniversary of living in Seattle, and we definitely went all out with our menu choices!
We ordered:
- Gnochhi al gorgonzola
- Rigatoni al sugo di carne
- Ziti ai formaggi
- Parmigiania di melenzane (EVERYONE'S FAVORITE!)
- Formaggi italiani
- Margherita pizza
Everything was absolutely delicious and full of flavor. As mentioned, the favorite was most definitely the eggplant, as it was the most flavorful and just overall surprised all of us in its taste. I was also a huge fan of the gnocchi, which was recommended by others, as the dish had the perfect gnocchi texture and the creamy sauce was absolutely delicious.
Overall, for the amount of food that we ordered and our total bill, I'd say the quality and quantity of our meal was marvelous. We all left happy, full, and excited to come back soon for another Monday night Happy Hour!","Lois C.","Ehh what a disappointing visit. My girlfriends and I visited Mama Melina for the first time yesterday for dinner. Immediately I fell in love with the lovely ambiance and the interior designing here. Too bad the food and also the service was poorly executed. Im still confused to know who our main server was. It seemed like everytime someone came by, it was a different person.
Anyway, I arrived late compared to my friends and when I asked to see the beer menu, the waiter had no idea where it could be then said ""ill be right back"" moments passed by and still nothing... I had to ask for the beer menu 3 times before I got an answer. Finally when I ordered, it took 7 minutes for them to bring me my beer. Really?
Don't let the food presentation fool you. It may look great, but it was pretty boring and did not catch my attention. Could use more seasoning. Pretty restaurant, but not so pretty customer service and food.","Morgan S.","DELICIOUS ITALIAN FOOD!!
The food: omg amazing! We popped in here for dinner and was honestly blown away! The food was exquisite! For appetizers we ordered two Caesar salads and a margarita pizza. Great salads! - the dressing was light and refreshing. The pizza was AMAZING! It's a Neapolitan style pizza (my fav!) and they truly made it right here. The margarita was a great one to get because it was fresh and bursting with flavor. For drinks we got the blueberry lemon rocks - SO GOOD (very refreshing!) and a glass of red wine. For the entrees we got a risotto ai gamberi - Phenomenal! Absolutely bursting with flavor! We also had the bucatini which was honestly to die for! We also ordered linguine with prawns as well as the pasta e fagioli. All the entrees were absolutely delicious! Truly an authentic upscale Italian restaurant. The prices were reasonable as well!
The atmosphere: a super cool and modern interior with a beautiful (DOG FRIENDLY!) patio! You can dress up or down. They have two spots in the restaurant which accommodate large parties.
The service was great and the food was even better!
Will I come back? YES YES YES","Mona M.","Wanting to get some super late dinner, we found Mamma Melina open until 11pm on Sunday! Plus when we got there, we were informed that it was happy hour until closing that night (and Saturday), so we went to sit at the bar area for the happy hour. The lighting here is quite dim giving an intimate/romantic ambience. The setup in the dining area was specially romantic with the classic chandelier and all. I really like the interior here.
The service wasn't the greatest which was apparent the moment we stepped in and not greeted with the slightest smile both from the hostess and the waitress. But I did find that she was quite attentive in checking on us.
We ordered Spaghetti al' ortolano which has grape tomatoes, pine nuts, big chunks of goat cheese and rucola. I don't usually care for goat cheese but this meal was enjoyable thoroughly specially with the crunch from the pine nuts as well, the flavor was very light though. We also ordered the Melina pizza which is the black truffle pizza with mushroom and mozzarella. This one is yum! The black truffle is very prominent. It reminded us with the NYC black truffle pizza that we had (that went viral before), minus the oozing egg.
For drink we got X-rated Tini (mango, passionfruit liqueur with sky blood orange soda) and Plum Blossom (pearl plum vodka, lemon juice and triple sec). Both drinks were very very good. The X-rated Tini is more a citrusy refreshing cocktail, while the Plum Blossom reminds me a lot of a cotton candy type of cocktail. I was pleased with the food and drink. Probably would order their eggplant parmigiana and their risotto next time. For dessert, we were hoping to order their cannoli but the waitress told us that they hadn't made it in a long time so we got their Tiramisu. The tiramisu sadly is pretty standard. Our bill came to about $60 excluding tax. Overall, for the portion and quality, I do find the price to be overpriced. However for a quick bite late dinner, we'd probably go back here again.","Alana B.","Delicious food with great service! I did one of their special order pizzas and it was one of the best I've had - they're fresh prosciutto is amazing. Their bread is good, but would recommend abstaining from filling up on it so you can eat their main courses - we had salads, risotto, and pizza - all equally delicious with great price points as well.","Luciana L.","Went to Mama Melina on mother's day. The food is good ( it was not my first time there) but the service was too slow - I know, it was mother's day but the restaurant was not so full to justify a 40 minutes waiting time to have our meal. The place is very modern with some touch of classic decoration. You can easily park in the public park at the back of the building. The restaurant is close to the Burke Gilman Bike trail just in case you are riding your bike and getting hungry. Our server - was very nice and polite. I will come back other time but not on mother's day.
My daughter had avocado toast and it was bland. She would not recommend it. I had the gnocchi and it was very tasty. My husband had the salmon linguini and it was ok. I got happy when he told me the food that I prepare was better. So, one star from my daughter, three stars from my husband and four stars from me. I still think that the waiting time had something to do with their reviews. And yes, we had reservations for mother's day!","Jackie N.","Love this place always! I got the salad with butter lettuce and nuts and goat cheese and the kale raviolis. Almost get the same thing every time because it is always so so good i can't choose anything else. The restaurant is beautiful as well and the service was great. We were in a rush when eating and the waiter was very fast and accommodating","Elyse M.","I came here for a rehearsal dinner in a large group. They served everything family style and everything had been preordered.
The vegan items I had were a salad and a penne and vegetable dish. The salad was typical, as was the penne and vegetables. The penne was more flavorful than some dishes I've had elsewhere, but not super flavorful, it was borderline bland.
The staff was helpful and friendly, making sure my order was on track while balancing feeding the rest of the group and making sure everyone was taken care of.
I probably wouldn't come here on my own but the service was great and the decor is really pretty. Definitely a good location for a semi-formal meal.","Vy L.","Their food is very good. We knocked off 2 stars because their customer service needs a lot of improvement and for that reason, we would never come back here.","Shelley V.","One star is actually pretty generous. Seriously, you can find much better Italian food literally anywhere else - or just cook some at home. It doesn't take formal training to make food better than this!","Luise M.","I had the sword fish tonight with potatoes and fresh vegetables on the side.
DELICIOUS!!! That's all I can say.
Aron and Maddy are running the bar and food like pros.
I love the atmosphere and the vibe this fantastic restaurant exudes.
Heather and Evangelina are the superstar waiters. Friendly and accommodating!
I had a beet salad recently that was close to heaven.
Marinated in fresh orange made it taste delicious.
Love, love ... Seattle, you have a gem!","Priya R.","Absolutely love this place for happy hour! Hands down the best ravioli and gnocchi I've had. If you come for lunch/dinner they serve the best bread platter as well. Prices are reasonable and its in a great location near udistrict.","Tigger H.","Beautiful little restaurant. We had lovely service and outstanding food. All was well within a decent price range for how fresh everything tasted. My partner and I spent spring break in Italy and ate our hearts out. Mamma Melina's is certainly holding its own here in Seattle.","Aaron S.","Went in for sunday funday with a friend and orded a Blood orange martini for happy hour! Was really impressed at the staff and the quickness if the drink, enjoyed the vibe, will deffinatly be back.","Nikki H.","Best happy hour! Anytime we get a date night this is the place we always go back to choosing. They have happy hour all day on Sunday's and Monday's but only in the bar so sometimes you have to wait for a table to open up but it's well worth it.
I highly recommend the lobster and crab Mac and cheese, it's so delicious! The Caesar salad never disappoints and the blood orange martins are a must order every time. The hot fudge lava cake is mouth watering and the staff is so friendly. I always look forward to coming here and always leave so full!
The staff is always friendly and does a good job on checking in to see how everything tastes and if anything is needed. The prices are great and we never have trouble finding parking.","Jenny T.","Great location. Interior was a lot larger that I was expecting. It was perfect for our party of 8. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Four of us ordered the smoked salmon with linguini. We all found it to be delicious but definitely on the salty side. Stay away if you do not like salty. Over all great experience","Jen K.","I have been here several times and keep coming back because of the location, happy hour deals, and nice ambience. The service is great and the outdoor patio is very comfortable. The only minor issue is that some of the dishes I have ordered weren't amazing, but still solid. As a low-carber it can be hard to order at an Italian restaurant but they are very helpful in making substitutions when requested. Very kid friendly too."
"Serafina","https://www.yelp.com/biz/serafina-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ojus P.","Very strong pasta and sauce. Would be happy to come back.
Ate at the bar on a Wednesday night. Gets a cold breeze every time someone opens the door so I'd advise getting a reservation.
Bruscetta - 3/5. Crispy, slightly burnt bread. 3 dips with a decent olive tapanade and cheese.
Melanzane - 4.5/5. Crispy, cheese filled eggplant. Really rich and robust tomato sauce. Well salted. Light pasta at the base adds variety in texture. Very well executed.","Tazeen L.","Brought OOT guests so the pressure was on, unfortunately the place didn't quite deliver... pretty empty on sunday night around 7ish but the place was cute- little rustic, neighborhoody, had a decent table by the windows...
My food was good, split the plin as an appetizer which was good but lukewarm. Did hit the carb craving though and I definitely finished off my app... had scallops for my main which were a decent portion, well seasoned and quite tasty. Others had mixed review on entrees though... Pain came with service alllllll night long. Items forgotten, waitstaff rarely checking in ( so constantly had to flag down which took surprisingly long given the relatively empty dining room) and on occasion having a bit of an attitude. Definitely didn't get the bread other reviews have mentioned.
Probably will not be making a return trip given the other strong Italian contenders but I suppose I get the local appeal if you live in the neighborhood. Also maybe the sister restaurant is worth a try given the reviews...","Alex O.","Lasagna: 2.5/5
Rigatoni Bolognese 1.5/5
Chocolate Cake: 1/5
Probably an honest mistake but I was the only table that didn't receive bread.
Lasagna: I've had better frozen lasagna than this. The cheese was burnt to a black crisp and left a bitter taste in my mouth. The marinara sauce was watered down. Sacrificing quality for quantity.
Rigatoni Bolognese: The pasta is made in house. Al dente. Great but the only thing I tasted was salt and pepper.
Chocolate Cake: It sort of tasted like chocolate but if you blinded folded me I don't think I could tell you what it was. Also, fresh blueberries will always be better than frozen blueberries.
Keep in mind this restaurant changes it dessert menu.","Chris J.","How have I not done a review for the quaint, adorable little restaurant yet? I love Serafina. Delicious food, good service, romantic ambiance. Their patio out back is a must during warmer weather.","Madison S.","A real treat. I love the homemade pasta dishes.
We came for lunch on a Friday. Open doors, inviting tables, good customer service. A lovely Italian moment. The bread and garlic olive oil is a great starter. I highly recommend getting a pasta dish!","Ashley K.","Ended up here by accident because Cicchetti is closed on Monday (now you know that fact as well). But they share a patio with them, so you're not at a total loss.
During happy hour on Monday, it was a 15-minute wait for a patio spot on a sunny summer day, so if that's your calling as well, be prepared for a potential wait, especially if you've got more than two.
We were hungry but not famished and ordered the cheese plate and the meat board. Both were amazing, and the server's knowledge of the various eats was impressive. The different options were so varied, and the accompaniments were great. I wouldn't change a thing. The pate was especially good.
To drink, I had one of their roses, again the waiter was super helpful in describing them. My companion got a cocktail that was amazing, so you can't really go wrong on the drink options. I'll be back!","Jennifer F.","Wow. Amazing food and great service. We met our family here last night for dinner and were very impressed. All pastas are made in house. Lasagna and the pasta bolognese were heavenly. The tortilloni with wild mushrooms and charred corn was incredible. My daughter is vegetarian and gluten free and there weren't a lot of options on the menu so she asked the chef to surprise her. Wow did he ever! This incredible plate arrived with romesco sauce, brocollini, sautéd artichokes, two eggs and then a drizzle of truffle oil. OMG! We all wanted her plate. Delicious. Dessert was affogato and this tart, scrumptious tangerine sorbet. What a great evening!","Rica M.","Came here with my mom for dinner! This is one of my mom's favorite places to come to lunch, and my first time coming to this restaurant. The overall experience was good with delicious food. The host took my jacket and our waiter began taking our drink orders almost immediately. It was dinner and it felt a little cramped with spacing however my mom reassured me that the atmosphere during lunch is better. Although it felt a little cramped, all of those thoughts quickly disappeared as soon as I took one bite of the food.

--------------
The highlights of the meal: Cozze, Rigatoni, Agnolotti dal Plin, and Latticello.
Overall delicious food, even the house-infused oil that you dip your bread into was so savory!
I had high hopes for the lasagna however it was a little too salty and lacked structure, I was going to say something to the waiter but we finished the lasagna nonetheless.
The Cozze was so delightful, the smokiness of the mussels, the flavors of the rich broth, the bread we already had on the table was the perfect match to help soak up the broth, in fact we liked it so much we ended up ordering more bread to go with the broth (we didn't order the grilled bread $3 to the Cozze because we already had bread on the table). Frankly, although we got this dish as an appetizer, I wouldn't mind eating it as an entree...
The Rigatoni... My only complaint is that I wish I had more! The rigatoni was cooked al dente and the Bolognese sauce was absolutely perfect for the rigatoni.
The Agnolotti was so cute and tasty. The rich flavors from the duck confit and roasted chestnut were the perfect pair with the sage and balsamic vinegar. The sage really brought out all of the flavors in ways I never imagined, this dish inspired me so much that I went to the store the next day to buy sage to try to make an interpretation of this very dish. Alas, I wasn't as successful and am totally okay with returning to Serafina for this dish!
The Laticello. Order it. Even if you don't have room. You won't regret it. I would come back to Serafina just for this cake in fact. Imagine a tiramisu but wayyyyyyyy better!!! The combination of the soft buttermilk cake, creamy coffee mousse and hints of the marsala, amaretto caramel, orange, pomegranate, and espresso tuile are spot on. It's a rich dessert with great flavors and the orange really brings it all together full circle.
Overall, great meal, will be back for lunch with my mom!","Katie V.","Came here with my boyfriend for our 1 year and it could not have been more perfect. The ambience was nice and the pastas we ordered were delicious. Usually we can't finish them but the portion size was perfect. Can't wait to come back in the summer for the outside dining area!","Helen K.","Wow, wow, wow.
I think I would feel justified writing a billion wow's and calling it a review, because Serafina established, for me, an impeccably high standard for Italian cuisine. That said, if my billion wow's can't convince you to drop by this gem of a restaurant, please read on.
From the start, the service at Serafina was wonderful. My boyfriend and I made reservations that night, and we did not experience any waits as a result. The hostess kindly took our coats without my having to ask, and the waitress was attentive to our dining experience from start to finish, describing dishes in detail with excitement and patience for the many questions we had (my boyfriend and I are both on the curious side LOL). Shoutout to Beth, who was the best waitress ever!
With regards to the food, we began with the pane. The olive oil dip was unique, sprinkled with what seemed like red pepper flakes that added a delightful kick for each bite of the bread. For the mains, my boyfriend ordered the agnello, and I ordered the melanzane, both of which were phenomenal. The agnello was perfectly tender, pairing perfectly with the polenta. The melanzane, Serafina's version of eggplant parmesan, took me back to Rome with one bite. The portions for both dishes were also incredibly generous, and my boyfriend (who calls himself the ""bottomless pit"") had a difficult time finishing.
My only qualm about Serafina is the extremely difficult parking. The only option is limited street parking, which was frustrating even for me, an L.A. transplant. That said, the parking situation is worth it.
For me, really good food doesn't just satisfy your stomach or tastebuds but touches some part of you that isn't merely physical. Call me dramatic, but there are foods out there that we call ""soul food"" for that reason! Serafina serves up food belonging to that class, and I'm happy to say that I'll be coming back for more.","Allison R.","This spot. You feel like you're on a get away. Highly recommend. Date night, girls night. Excellent food, wine, and service. One of my fave spot in Seattle.","Christine P.","I love this place! We come here about once yearly every time we visit Seattle, my hometown. The wines and menu selections are varied and the food itself is absolutely delicious. This is the restaurant we choose for celebrating special occasions and Seattle family get-togethers. I will keep returning for the cuisine in the beautiful setting of this restaurant.","Jenny Z.","Came here on a sunny Saturday afternoon. While the whole restaurant was full, we got great service at the bar! Drinks were delicious (loved my midnight negroni) and food came quickly. Bartender made great recommendations! They were both great but the eggplant dish (Melanzane) may have been my favorite eggplant of all time. We will be back for a more formal dinner sometime! It was such a lovely large space with good natural light!","Torrie N.","I hadn't been to Serafina in YEARS, but remember having enjoyed it in the past, so was excited to check it out for Seattle Restaurant Week for lunch for the 2 courses. I went with some coworkers and we had made a reservation. Upon arriving, there were several tables available but for whatever reason, we were seated at a table in the corner, right against a half wall where it was super dark. Kind of weird, since usually when you make a reservation you get a decent/better table. We asked if we could move and they had no problem moving us to the table next to us. (No one sat at our original table so doesn't appear that they were saving it for another reservation).
As for the meal itself, I had the antipasti of the day which was a mushroom soup (cant remember the exact description since it wasn't printed on the menu). It was creamy, flavorful and pretty tasty! For the main dish, 3 out of 4 of us got the pasta which was Orechiette with peas and mushrooms (again, don't remember exact description) but it was VERY underwhelming. There wasn't much flavor at all, and no sauce really (just a little oil). The only saving grace was the Parmesan crisp on top (garnish) which added some flavor/saltiness that was much needed. Mushrooms were mentioned in the item description but there were literally 2 tiny pieces of mushroom on the pasta, but plenty of peas, which don't add THAT much flavor or depth (see pic). Hmm.. the rest was just the pasta. I can't emphasize how little flavor there was. Usually I'm sensitive to salt and tend to think things are over-seasoned. In this case, it was really quite the opposite - no complexity to the dish at all. Our other friend who opted for the meatballs commented that the meatballs were a little dry. I don't think she meant the meatballs themselves, but there was minimal sauce on top of the meatballs so the sauce was gone way before the meatballs were... it seemed like a stingy serving of the sauce.
The service was decent and everything else was fine, but I just can't get over how subpar the pasta was... I hope that this was just a fluke with this particular SRW dish, but for $20 for lunch, you'd expect to really have a tasty, enjoyable meal. I may give them another try but this place is definitely not a high priority.","Jenna K.","Came here for Seattle Restaurant Week! Overall, I had a very pleasant experience - phenomenal food, good service, classic atmosphere. I got the three course for $35, and ordered the seafood soup as an appetizer, pork tenderloin as an entree, and the chocolate cake for dessert.
Both the soup and pork were delicious and very well seasoned. The soup has a spicy kick and a lot of texture that made the dish very fun. The pork tenderloin has this sweet, acidic sauce that balanced out the heaviness of the meat. I would highly recommend them!
However, the chocolate cake was a little bit underwhelming. I don't know if they make it in house, but it wasn't as great nor as creative as the other two dishes. If you are not coming here for SRW, I would recommend getting dessert somewhere else.
Service was overall pretty pleasant, but there were some caveats. First, the bread is $5 - although it's delicious bread, and I would highly recommend getting it, they don't inform you that it's an extra charge. There is also an additional 3% automatic ""service charge"" that is distributed to the kitchen staff. Once again, it would have been great if they noted it on the menu beforehand or something.
Regardless of the small caveats, I would definitely come here again, and would recommend it to other people. The food was great and had a very pleasant time there.","Sheryl F.","Serafina - you've always held a special place in my heart and I can't believe I don't visit more often! I had a fantastic experience the other evening, in the crazy snowstorm, and will definitely be back (and was smiling at how many other people braved the snow to stop by and enjoy your food and ambiance).
My dirty grey goose martini - was perfect! (And I'm really judgey about my martinis!) The wine we had was perfect with our meals. And my pasta - seriously, decadent, heavenly, and just what I needed.","Sasa S.","Delicious food! Even the oil that you dip the bread in was to die for. I tried the gnocchi with goat cheese (yum) and the duck confit pasta (omg yes, but tiny portion for a full size......) and the arancini (good but not standout), and the Limone salad (yes). The rest of the food my table ordered that I didn't get a chance to try was also raved about by all. I was sad they didn't offer tiramisu but their cheesecake did not disappoint. The waiter wasn't particularly friendly or available but we made do. Overall a wonderful experience, mostly due to the quality of the food at a not-overly-expensive price.","Safina H.","Really enjoyed my experience here. Great recommendations from the waiter, lovely outdoor seating. I ordered the cavatelli and my friend ordered the agnolotti. Both were well flavored and delicious, although I wish it was less salty. The strawberry dessert was fantastic! Will definitely be back","Joel L.","We started with Polpo braised octopus appetizer opening up our tastebuds. It's a must try! Rigatoni Bolognese is wonderfully delicious and a healthy portion.The saltiness of pecorino cheese balanced the rich sauce, lamb & fennel sausage. One of the best meals that was quite memorable. It has been almost a decade since I have been here. New ownership, still incredible as before. A great establishment for any occasion.
I will definitely be back more often.","R S.","We tried the place during SRW and tried the prix fixe menu. It was OK, not great. Tables are way to close to each other, the guy with the loud voice dominated the entire area with his talking. The food was redundant and bland and nothing special. The fresh fish was a salmon stew with tomato base, maybe someone would make that choice as a fresh fish, but not me.
Wines by the glass are very expensive for what they are, offering wines with long names from obsure winerys from other countries is deceiving to me, especally if they are cheap varietals being passed off as something special.
They poured a huge amount of sediment in one glass of ours, it was a terrible turn off and a sign the person who poured it did not know what they were doing or did not care if they served the dregs of the bottle to a customer. Who does that?
Service was OK, not great or bad."
"Bucatini","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bucatini-edmonds?osq=Italian+Food","Tom B.","This is one place where you really can learn a lot just by looking at the photos. You can see hearty Italian food, fairly traditional, presented beautifully in a nice dining room. That's a good summary of what's on offer here.
This is one of many strip malls in block after block of strip malls on the way down to the Edmonds ferry. There's just enough parking (barely).
Inside, everything's just nice enough--you're not paying for a bunch of fountains and premium real estate, but the whole bar and both dining rooms are pretty. Dimly lit, nice earthy paint colors on the walls, fun vintage ads, nice furniture and table settings. There's not much of a lobby, and the place gets busy. They don't take reservations, either, so you might be waiting outside if you come during the rush.
The menu is fairly short. Lots of classics, almost always with local ingredients and some creative touch from the chefs and cooks in back. There's a wine list, and a few beers on tap and in bottles. Full bar, too.
For food, one server pointed out that their special list really is the creative heart of the kitchen. What they feel like cooking and the ingredients they're most excited about are what shows up there. The regular menu has tons of stuff you want, too, and it's where the starters are. They're always welcome with any meal.
The food here runs to a hearty, home-cooked vibe. Some of the ingredients are a little fancier than your average home dinner, but they slow-cook the sauces and give you big portions; you feel like your grandma is worried you're not eating enough, so she gave you this. Not only is it a big serving, but it's something she figures you'll eat every bite of even if you're getting full.
Even the lunch portions are huge, by the way. The dinner portions blow those away. You could easily order fewer entrees than you have people and share plates, especially if you get starters.
We had the caesar salad, which has real caesar dressing made from scratch in house. With eggs. Real caesar! I love it. You can get anchovies, and you can wear your server out waiting for just the right-size mountain of fresh ground black pepper. This is a proper way to start a meal. They're also constantly bringing you out some really nice bread.
We got a bottle of a local cab for $35, from Virtue. It was an amazing bargain at that price, and suited the meal perfectly. Their headquarters are close to Edmonds, too, which is cool.
For entrees, we had the Pescatore Romano, which was a mountain of shellfish and a little finfish on squid ink pasta. The Tre Ragu was a heap of elk, lamb, and something else on big noodles. Both came simmered in garlicky, herby tomato sauce (I assume slightly different recipes). We couldn't finish all the fish, but the meat dish was all gone, right down to the last of the sauce sopped up with still more bread.
We missed the desserts and after-dinner drinks, but this was a huge hearty meal served quickly and presented beautifully for less than most places charge for such ($135 for 4 total plates + wine). This would be an easy place to get addicted to. We'll definitely get back.","Vy P.","This place was a nice surprise! My friend and I were craving some Italian food and we decided to check this place out. I had not heard much about it and, *surprise*, I didn't even check Yelp before going... Everything was quite with a small hiccup in service.
LOCATION & PARKING //
It's in this very small and dark side plaza in Edmonds (across from PCC). It's not very well lit from the outside so keep an eye out if you're using Google Maps or something. I had to make a small u-turn once I realized I passed it. The location itself is small but cozy. There is parking in a private lot so I wouldn't worry about that.
FOOD //
I got the FARFADELLE ALFREDO with CHICKEN. I love anything with alfredo so I figured this would be a good choice... and it was. First of all, the other reviewers are correct. The portions here are huge. I only ate about 1/3 of my plate and took the rest for home. The pasta was smooth and buttery. The sauce was not too overwhelming and it was the right texture. Some places make these dishes too ""saucy"" but I felt like there wasn't a pool of sauce on the bottom. In fact, the sauce just coated the pasta, as it should. They also give a decent amount of chicken too! Best part? The pasta tasted just as delicious as leftovers.
I also want to touch on the complimentary bread... because it was super soft and fluffy. Seriously, go for it.
AMBIANCE //
Like I mentioned before, it's small and cozy. I didn't expect that from here. It's strange to say, but it reminds me of a cozy inn in a small town. It's a great spot for families, dates, friends, etc. The entire vibe is very intimate.
SERVICE //
I feel quite conflicted about this because the service from the servers was absolutely fantastic. I never felt rushed to order or pay the check and they consistently checked up on us. My concern here is how we (and other customers) were addressed and seated. When we arrived, there was a man who seemed to be in charge of seating everyone. We weren't acknowledged for 5 minutes and when he walked us to our table, it felt like he was annoyed at us/servers in general. It was quite strange.
OVERALL // 4.5 stars
I had a great experience here and will consider coming back if I'm craving some Italian food. Not sure what really happened with the small service problem though...","Kellye M.","We had the caprese salad, bolongnese alforno, tortellini con pesto. Everything was excellent. Liked the bolongnese the most. Truly spectacular. We also had the cannoli cake. That had to be the best cake I've ever had. It was moist. The frosting had a nice orange flavor and it was just delicious, and I don't like cannoli.
Nice family atmosphere. Very homey. Staff was very friendly. Keely was an excellent waitress. Will definitely come again!","Annie Y.","I just love this place. The owner of the restaurant is always around and you can sense the dedication in the food. Everything we've ordered so far was delicious and plentiful. Service has always been friendly and unobtrusive. We love to get one of the specials when we visit and it's ones of those few places where you can't go wrong with anything you try. They have a relatively small kitchen but they dish out big flavors. Super impressive, a standout in the neighborhood.","Samuel W.","Do not order Bolognese Al Forno! I had a terrible experience yesterday at lunch with this extremely salty food. Waitress was kind enough to bring me more plain pasta and glass of water, but could not help much with the ready made sauce.","Shaylor S.","Most authentic Italian place I've been to. Was pretty skeptical with this place because it is a bit pricer and I wasn't sure it would be worth it. Mamma Mia I was very wrong. Guys!! Come here.
I got ""the grinder"" not really knowing what it was going to be like. They came out with a literal canoe-shaped thing of bread that was perfectly cooked, crispy, and fresh. It was filled with multiple cheeses, very unique cut of salami (my absolute favorite), tiny onion bulbs that were still intact but cooked and caramelized to perfection, and a bunch of other flavorful things that made this one of the best Italian dishes I've had! I was really hungry and I couldn't even finish it! Had to take the last little bit home because it was so good. Portion sizes parallel the price you're paying so don't let the price deter you too much.
The other reason this place is 5 stars is because the service here is unmatched. They focus on the little things like making sure your drink is always filled up, replacing the appetizer bread (that is free) before you can think to ask for more, giving everyone a mint at the end, giving you a full rundown of their specials, having thick towel-like napkins, going out of their way to thank you for coming in, and so much more! For me, those little things go a long way.
Some big things they do is hook you up when you misunderstand what you ordered. One of my friends thought they ordered something that had a similar name to something else and when they brought it out she realized it was not was she ordered. The waitress took it back and within five minutes she brought out the correct one. It wasn't anyone's fault but they took on themselves to make the customer a priority. We were all very pleased.
The only thing I didn't like was the water because it tasted a little like plastic. It was only the first couple refills that had that taste. But besides that, I got nothing but positive stuff to say!
Great Italian atmosphere that is authentic, hospitable, inviting, packed with freshness and flavor! They just do it right here.","Mona M.","I'm no Italian but I felt right at home. I felt like we were treated like a family even though it was our first time here. They made us feel like our business is important to them and that out presence mattered from the moment we entered the restaurant until we walked out that door.
When we arrived at the restaurant for an early dinner, there were several people waiting for a table. The owner Anthony happened to be entering the restaurant at the same time like we did. He smiled widely, greeted us and held the door open for us. The two of us were able to get a seat immediately. Bread is served as a starter as you browse through their menu (olive oil and balsamic vinegar at the table). Our waitress was super nice and all smiles. She made recommendation, checked on us a lot but mostly gave us our privacy.
We got the half salad upon her recommendation, portion is actually huge. I could overhear our waitress saying the same thing to other patrons that the Caesar's salad is the best that she has ever had. But I agree that it was indeed very good. For meal I got Di Mare Puttanesca which was their squid ink pasta served the entire habitat of the ocean in it. I mean seriously my plate came with a generous helping of lobster, tuna, rock fish, mussels, clams, calamari, octopus, and prawns swimming in a spicy marinara with capers, anchovies, and Kalamata olives. Dear God the portion is HUGE! Meanwhile he had the Carbonara Antonio with smoked pork belly bacon which was delicious though a little on the salty side.
We weren't able to finish our meal because we got sooo full. Nonetheless we couldn't pass on dessert. We opted for Spumoni as it would be easier to swallow than cake. Well, I love the spumoni. We got three scoops and it was not too sweet.
Excellent service with great food. I definitely enjoy the vibe here. It seems like everyone knows everyone, truly feels like being among friends and family in here. Parking can be tough, but they mention there's another nearby parking that you can park at (I think it was at the bank or something.. I can't seem to remember the exact details now - please call the restaurant for details.)","Nathan S.","This is a no-nonsense, legit Italian eating place. I lived in Italy for 2 years and returned back to the States 9 years ago. I'm always a little... or a lot... let down when I try Italian restaurants because it's just never the same as the real thing. This is the first Italian place since Italy that I have loved! No complaints. I'll even let the chicken Alfredo dish slide since I understand they have to appease our misguided American demand.
This trip made my 4th of July weekend. Great food, great service, fair price for the quality and quantity you get. I wish I didn't live 3 hours away. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but the I side is nice, and their attention is on the food...none of the flashy stuff.
Bravissimo! Si mangia!","Melanie J.","I am so full!
We love this place, and we should have left a review a long time ago. My family is never disappointed, lunch or dinner... so delicious!
One of those amazing, unassuming places. Fresh, fresh, fresh, and passion in the form of food. Can't go wrong, unless you go to another Italian place in Edmonds, then you have sold yourself short. Thank goodness, they are growing to handle the demand. Highly recommend and bonus, the staff has always been great!","Brian M.","One of the better Italian places I've been to. Their ""featured items"" we tried were excellent. A small cozy place with a bar, I recommend business casual attire. Parking stalls are on the slimmer side.","Sharmi R.","We ordered chicken Parmiginana sandwich , which was so huge and one person can't finish it as it's really cheesy. It was good and we need to finish it before it turns cold so please plan to share it . We also got the Di mare puttanesca which was huge portion of seafood with ink pasta. There were more mussels and only few shrimp and just 1 piece of small lobster tail which was disappointing. The pasta was chewy probably could have been cooked a bit more. These 2 dishes were like 4 star but I am giving 3 star because of the kid dish. The kid's pasta was so chunky and undercooked with a TBs of shredded parmigiana and butter. My kid is a good eater and won't complain much, trust me it was so bland and bad. There was like 3 kid's option and I am not sure what others tasted like. I am rating this 3* just because of kids menu. We were the only ones in the restaurant but still no cutlery even after 7-8 mins after lunch was served, they apologized for the same still I feel it should have been done right considering the restaurant was empty. We enjoyed food though just not my kiddo.","Rochelle H.","This was a pleasant surprise. Was meeting a friend for dinner and chose this from Yelp. I was so good. Tony is the nicest and the staff is so kind. The flavors make your mouth water. It was full with patrons but the wait was not long. I will drive up from Bonney Lake for another meal. Excellent!! Definite do again.","Matt C.","Long live this meal.
Bucatini is a hidden gem tucked away in an Edmonds strip mall. The low lit, romantic wine bar is home to 5-star eats from beginning to end. It truly was a perfect dining experience and I need to write this review while it's still fresh in my mind!
Oddly enough I didn't order a pasta dish. I know what you're thinking, ""Matt, are you okay? Is something bothering you? Why aren't you consuming pasta 24/7?""
I'll tell you why. Typically at a fancy Italian restaurant, I would 100% order a composed Italian pasta dish. However, Bucatini has...get this...a Heroes & Grinders menu! Any good Italian knows the immortalized significance of this. I am so, so happy with my decision to order ""The Grinder.""
The Grinder - Capicola, Mortadella and Calabrese Salami w/ Grilled Caramelized Onions & Provolone on Toasted Ciabatta. Say hello to heaven, folks. This sandwich had it all; salty, savory, sweet, cheesy and crispy components that worked phenomenally. Plus, the sandwich was the size of my head. Have you seen my head? Yeah, it's that big!
I'm also not one to praise a salad, but the Caesar Salad I ordered prior to my sandwich was a 6-star salad. Homemade dressing, whole leaf lettuce and deliciously addictive croutons, with a squeeze of fresh lemon elevated this salad into a beautiful starter.
Service was stellar. Our waitress knew the specials like the back of her hand, filled every glass, and was continuously one step ahead. The owner even came out to talk to us and the other tables, which is always a memorable touch. Cannot recommend Bucatini enough!
Do you ship grinders to Jacksonville? I'll pay for overnight shipping.","Jodi B.","Have visited Bucatini's a few times now since recently moving into the area and the food never disappoints. I've never ventured outside of pasta with regards to what to eat, but also why would I? It's amazing! Bucatini Alla Napolitana is a personal favorite, delicious, the Polpi Nona is also great, but on the specials so unsure how often it's available. They also just expanded and doubled in size, which is cool to see for a local business.. You should definitely give this place a try if you're in the area!","SJ S.","Can't rave enough about this place. Tonight I chose to call for take out on a rainy blustery night. Bucatini with House made Meatballs, Bolognese and a side of Sausage. Gotta have the sausage. 15-20 minutes later it was ready. Just LOVE the food here. It is always good. Dine in or take out. Either both. Place is awesome. The only thing I forgot was to add a bottle of wine. (An option even to go). The selection is great and extremely reasonable. Thanks guys. My dinner was delish!
Back today to grab grinders for workers. Everyone loved them and wanted to know where they came from. Two of them enjoyed The Steak Grinder and said it was the best Steak Sandwich they had ever had in their lives. Thanks Bucatini for a great meal and making me look good! Awesome as always.","Shannon M.","First time here. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It's a small place. No reservations, we came around 5pm and got in without a wait. Garlic aroma hit us as we walked in. We ordered an antipasto plate, clams and pasta, meat bolognese and a kids marinara. Marinara pasta had a bright flavor and was completely consumed. The bolognese was delish! We helped my daughter clean the bowl. House wines by the glass went well with the meal.
Would definitely return!","Jennifer K.","Wow! What a great, local, neighborhood restaurant. Upon arrival on a Saturday night we were absolutely shocked by the amount of people that were waiting. It didn't seem that busy until we realized ... ""OH it's really busy."" We waited for about 30 minutes till being seated (which I think was relevantly short compared to others) and we ordered immediately since we had plenty of time to browse over the menu.
We decided to go with the Steak grinder, Bucatini alla Napolitana and the Bucatini with Homemade meatballs. Warning: that is A LOT of food for just two people and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day. During dinner the severs and the atmosphere reminded us a lot of home and everything was right up our alley. If you're looking for good, no frills Italian that you can bring the whole family (especially with really good food) this is the place to go!","Mohamed N.","""Delightful Italian in slightly out-of-the-way strip mall""
We came here with a group of 6 on a Friday night at 6pm and were fortunately able to be seated in this rather small place, though the restaurant filled up very quickly thereafter. The restaurant is at the end of a strip mall with very limited parking, but there are signs noting that you can park at a nearby bank. One of my party has a severe legume/ soy allergy, but as with traditional Italian food (but unlike some chain places), this restaurant only uses olive oil and occasionally canola oil.
The setting is a bit dimly lit and cozy but not TOO crowded. The servers were quite attentive-- our glasses never fully emptied, and both they and someone I presume was the manager checked on us repeatedly. I was still full from lunch so I just ordered a caprese salad. My dining partners got the caprese classic sandwich, a different salad, or the Di Mare Puttanesca. We had delicious bread while we waited (refilled as many times as we wanted), and there was olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the table.
The food was DELICIOUS.
The caprese salad was a bit small, but exceptionally well done. It was exactly what I wanted. Probably not meant to be a meal by itself, but a good appetizer.
The caprese classic sandwiches were the salad in a GIANT half-ciabatta, and decorated with a cute Italian flag. Everyone loved them, and the bread soaked some of the balsamic and oil making it also delicious. Pro-tip: do NOT order this sandwich toasted-- it comes out like a giant crouton. It's nicely crispy without toasting. This will fill up a hungry eater for sure.
Our friends enjoyed their puttanseca and salad immensely too.
Overall, an excellent local, out-of-the-way option for high-quality Italian food. The price is fair for the high quality-- definitely a significant step up in quality, food presentation, and ambiance from Olive Garden and such (though I like those too).","C R.","Visiting friends in the area and we chose Bucatini for our New Years meal and we couldn't be happier! Fantastic food, very kind and attentive service, and a chef from New York with a passion for making dishes from scratch. Highly recommended!!!","Tracy W.","Wonderful Italian food. Haven't had Italian this great since I moved here from New York. Wonderful wine selection. Slower service happens on a busy weekend."
"Mondello Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mondello-ristorante-italiano-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Brian K.","I'm super happy to have found a very authentic Italian restaurant right next door! My girlfriend and I walked here the other day, and we were both surprised about how delicious the food was!!! We had one of the linguine dishes with meatballs, which were just perfectly seasoned and cooked just right, moist and delicious. We also had the ravioli, also very well done and the seasoning and sauce were well balanced to allow the homemade pasta to shine, but still give the right texture and complete the flavor of the dish!
The only Con to this place is the 25$ Corking fee!!!!! OOFF! That one hurts, so in the future we will not be drinking when we come here, but the food has allowed me to keep this place at a 5 star review despite the ridiculous corkage fee.
Keep up the good work guys!","Rebecca R.","Came here with a Groupon still on the hunt for a go to or even return to Italian restaurant in Seattle. The staff was super friendly and observant. Food arrived promptly. No problems with front of house service.
My order: Insalata Cesare, Fettuccine con Salsiccia, and a glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo for my meal and then tiramisu and a cappuccino for dessert.
The highlights of the evening for me were the wine, tiramisu and cappuccino. The tiramisu was lighter than I expected (perhaps more whipped cream or whipped egg whites to zabaglione and marscapone than normal) but the flavors were SPOT on. Seems from the other yelp reviews that the dessert are on point, so props to whoever is making those.
The salad was ok; not bad but also not super memorable.
The pasta was the real challenge for me. I enjoyed the sausage and the general flavor profile; however, the pasta was extremely stodgy. Some pieces of pasta were cooked differently than others and not all of it was even fettuccine (I think some linguine snuck in there). Overall the cook was way off to the point that I just ate the meat and a few bites and openly welcomed the arrival of dessert.
All in all, if I was in the neighborhood, I might stop by for some wine, tiramisu, and coffee and there is a slight chance I might try a different type of pasta, but this is not a place I would take my family to or go out of my way to return to.","Kenzi H.","This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Seattle. After visiting various Italian eateries, Mondello offers an authentic homemade pasta that takes me back to my time studying abroad in Italy.
I'm shocked there are not more reviews about this place! Mondello is a great date spot and a good place to take visiting family and friends.
The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is a hidden gem in the neighborhood. If you're in Magnolia for dinner - this is the place to be. I always order the Ravioli Marsala, it just melts in your mouth with each bite. I've also had the gnocchi and it's AMAZING! You just can't go wrong!","Upasna D.","Service was outstanding and decor was cute. Our server was warm and welcoming. Three stars because they only have two vegetarian entree options, both are cheese based. I asked the server if they are willing to customize and she said that they don't.","Ronald H.","We still mourn the passing last month of Mondello's guiding spirit, Mamma Enza Sorrentino. But tonight's oxtail special showed that the kitchen carries on splendidly.","Ridhima G.","Mondello's food is authentic and of top quality. We came here to celebrate my brother's birthday. I called in advance and the older lady was able to bake a cheesecake for the 7 of us. The cake was delicious and so fresh! Thank you to the team for making sure we had a great experience.","Cruz V.","Woah, this place was absolutely fabulous. The ambiance, server and food felt like a real life Italian experience. Perfect for an intimate date night. I want to highlight the spaghetti carbonara. I'd definitely go back!","Nicole Y.","Gnocchi Gorgonzola with ""special"" dehydrated ""chicken"" flown in all the way from the Arabian dessert. This chicken is so parched, you'll feel like you're lost in the Sahara with each bite. This virtual experience can be yours too for only $25 pr plate.
I was excited to try something new and the reviews here looked great--So, I figured I'd give this place a try. I've been craving gnocchi gorgonzola with chicken ever since I ordered it from Brunello Ristorante Italiano a few months ago and was complete wrecked by its deliciousness. But, my meal at Mondello was unfortunately disappointing. The gnocchi itself was not bad. However the gorgonzola sauce lacked flavor and the chicken was offensive. There's no way that someone who cares about what they do and the people they serve, would served anyone the chicken that came on my gnocchi. It was literally hard as a rock. It looked like a chicken topping from a dominos pizza delivery would look like after sitting in your fridge for three weeks. I don't understand why some restaurants send out shitty food via delivery. This is not entirely uncommon, though I cannot say it's a regular pattern at Mondello, as I haven't ordered from them but this one time. So many people order delivery these days, you would think restaurants would recognize that kill'n the delivery game would bring in loads of new customers. Unfortunately, the message Mondello sent me with my delivery, was that they don't care about their delivery customers or the quality of food they provide to them. I am not sure their food is better in house, but, I for sure wont be fooled into spending nearly $30 on a single entree of this quality from Mondello ever again.","Richard S.","Mama hasn't lost her touch! My wife and I ate there last night. The antipasto was a meat lovers dream. A few veggies but mostly prosciutto, ham and salami - cut very thin. The spaghetti bolognese was simply amazing. When I go to an Italian restaurant I avoid dishes like spaghetti bolognese because they are so ordinary. Not this one! My wife and I were in awe of this dish so enjoy!","Arthur K.","When going through the list of Eater's ""Iconic Dishes That Define Seattle Dining"" article, Mondello was the one restaurant I didn't recognize. They listed their lasagna as their signature dish. I had a business meeting coming up in the Magnolia area so I made it a point to my coworker to make a stop here for lunch.
The decor is old school, almost stereotypical, Sicilian. I got their iconic lasagna while my coworker got the gnocci al gorgonzla. The lasagna wasn't just cut out of a pan and plopped down in an unappetizing square as I expected. It almost looked like it was individually baked to order (of course I know it wasn't) and then dressed with a delicious sauce. The pasta was very soft but not soggy at all. I can see why this dish is so famous now.","Amy G.","My husband and I have been loyal customers of Mondello for years because it was the homey spot for good Italian food in our neighborhood. We were able to look past their fairly regular service blunders and mishaps, and the fact that the red wine was always served at 85+ degrees because we still felt welcomed and the food was plentiful and the quality was high.
But, after eating at Mondello a week ago, they have lost us. The family has faced the very sad loss of their matriarch, and the eyes on this restaurant now have a very different arrogance and focus on cutbacks for their own benefit. The place now feels like another manipulative Seattle restaurant taking sneaky steps to give you less for the same cost which will backfire as the experience and food quality has massively suffered.
We were made to wait for 10 minutes for a table even though we had a reservation. A pack 'em mentality. Newly implemented, bread is rationed at one piece per customer and refilled for a charge. Red wine is still served too hot, yet the price per glass probably exceeds the value of the whole bottle. Portion sizes have shrunk, now 5 ravioli where there used to be 6 and they taste nothing like they used to. Veal has been replaced with bread in the no-meatballs. I mean, come on! Isn't that like the oldest trick in the book?
It is so disappointing to see how greed has messed with was used to a pretty good thing.","Kati P.","Well....the service was very good. The homemade bread was unusual and very yummy.
The menu was very NON-CONDUCIVE for vegetarians. There were only two items on the entree menu and both were cheese-based. It's 2019 folks......there should be MANY choices for vegans and vegetarians.
The establishment was kind enough to make both of us a simple pasta dish with lots of veggies. We both asked for marinara sauce and our dishes came without any sauce, but rather in a clear 'soup'. We asked for sauce and a very watery and flavorless sauce arrived.
Both desserts we wanted were out, which was very sad. Why are they on the menu, if they're not available?
The biggest shock was the bill. We were charged the same price for our veggie pastas as dishes with meat or fish. Who charges $52 for two simple pasta dishes with no animal protein? Ridiculous.
We will not be dining there again. We have Italian restaurants much closer to home with rich red sauce and prices that are reasonable.
We felt very ripped off.","K C.","Mondello's is a little jewel box of a restaurant, and we felt lucky to pick it. Yelp reviewers, get to work. This restaurant needs to be higher on the list of recs.
Primarily pasta but homemade pasta it offers up fresh versions of favorites. My son had venison meatballs and I had pasta puttanesca. We shared an octopus appetizer that was incredibly tender. My only suggestion would be to offer some shrimp as an addition to the puttanesca.
The restaurant is charming and on the small side, but we will be back.
Visiting my son in Seattle three things are always on the agenda: dim sum, seafood and Italian. All three difficult to impossible to get in Flagstaff so we are two for three so far with dim sum and now Italian.","John E.","They are back to being the great restaurant I had missed for a few years after the last bad experience there.
Any pasta on the menu he is killer.","Marie B.","During my 'staycation', I revisited favorite sites in Seattle's Magnolia neighborhood, one of them being Mondello. As mentioned from other write-ups, it is one of those underrated, flying under the radar established restaurants. It was time to update my previous posts from 5/18/14 and 3/15/15.
Earlier this afternoon (11/26/17) I headed back to Seattle via Bainbridge Island ferry, texted family members to ask where a family member's birthday was to be celebrated. Coincidentally, Mondello came up while texting.
We all decided to meet up in Magnolia Village at a nearby indie café since Mondello didn't open until 5pm on Sundays. We showed up a few minutes shortly after opening, warmly greeted, and seated at the same 4 top coincidentally from previous visits.
The restaurant's matriarch, Enza, wasn't perched at her usual counter seat. But instead, we had Corino Bonjrada, Mondello's owner, do the personable meet and greet as we perused our menus.
Beverages:
glass of Rosso della Casa ($9), Orange San Pellegrino soda ($3.50, with refill), and plentiful ice water.
Starters included:
Warm slices of house bread with herby dipping olive oil.
Antipasto Misto ($16) which had cured prosciutto and Parma (?) ham, cheese drizzled with balsamic vinegar, but no olives present on the serving board.
Bresaola ($14) which was one giant slice of cured Painted Hills beef. I ended up poaching both the arugula with grated parmesan and the greens from the antipasto plate, this made for a tasty mini salad.
Zuppa di Lenticchie ($12) with flavorful lentils, homemade sausage served in a generous bowl.
(Note: This much delayed post continued on 1/28/18, over two months later. Checked and noted menu prices went up slightly compared to this November 2017 visit. Details now fuzzy and receipt faded, my apologies fellow Yelpers.)
Main entrees included:
Pesce del Giorno (market price, $35)
Ravioli Marsala ($18)
Spaghetti alla Carbonara ($18)
Desserts included:
Tiramisu ($9) with an espresso ($3)
Limoncello ($9)
Affogato ($11, but comp'ed by the owner)
The celebration continued when two flutes of Moscato d'Asti was also brought to the table, gratis.
For a spontaneous birthday dinner decision, this was spectacular success! Thank you to
Corino Bonjrada and all of his restaurant staff.
Grazie mille!","Jeremy W.","Best gnocchi ever. Ever. Excellent food. Quaint atmosphere. Friendly family owned/staffed. So happy to live around the corner from them!","Latifa S.","Surprise surprise!! So pleasantly surprised!!
I've knew about Mondello from their sister restaurant way back when several years ago! Just never trek it up here before. I mean I know La vita e Bella! I like the food!! Not crazy in love!!
But I guess this isn't the same! First: love the beautiful colors! Brought my mom for lunch here, we usually only do italian for family meals. Duh!! :)
Love: the gorgeous grandma that runs the spot! She's elegant! Spoke italian!! Si grazie!! Feel so home!!
Lunch menu was simple: fed appetizers! Several pasta and paninis. Pasta are basically traditional Sicilian dishes the classic like polpettes, carbonara and puttanesca. Nothing crazy elaborate! Though our neighbor tables swear by the ravioli in Marsala sauce! We went with our usuals!
Pasta vongole for moi! Always!! Love the wine and garlic parsley explosion!
Puttanesca with rigatoni has a nice kick!!
Fettuccini polpettes was good too!
Best part of all of this that got me squealed?? Fresh pasta!!!! It was love at half a bite. Ain't nothing like fresh pasta!! This is not the hand rolled but still it was perfect!! Usually I have to travel to my family in Rome for this much fresh pasta!!! Oh happiness!!!
I didn't even need my sauce to be honest!! Love it! So happy!! Too bad they don't have happy hour!! Or smaller plate options so I can try them all! Till then, grazie tanti per bella pranzo!!","Amy K.","One of the items on my culinary bucket list was squid ink pasta. This week I got to cross it off that list, thanks to the squid ink spaghetti with jumbo prawns dish I devoured at Mondello's.
Rustic and filled with the charm of an Italian villa, this restaurant hits the mark with its scratch-made pastas and cook-to-order entrees. The decor is Instagram-worthy and the vibe is like a big hug and kiss on both cheeks. While waiting a long wait for your food, you can expect a tableside visit by one of the owners and Mama Enza's homemade bread with garlic dipping oil.
I highly recommend the squid ink spaghetti, Mama Enza's lasagna and anything with seafood (their specialty). Mussels, specifically. Nothing is done in haste or on the cheap here, but if you can budget for it and aren't in a rush, you will walk away singing Bocelli.","Aaron M.","Not a good night for Ristorante Mondello. A Big Rock found in the her seafood special by our guest. Spinaci soffritti had no detectable butter, lemon, garlic or salt & it seemed to be sautéed in a pan that was not hot enough with olive oil. Spinach should be Awesome in an Italian place like this. Mondello is not special or quite up to average in the Neighborhood Italian restaurant category. Were told they were out of bread After we talked about ordering a couple Mussel and Clam appetizers and After we ordered an $85 bottle of wine. Was told when I asked about a bread store, that a grocery store was across the school yard and had baguette. It was a Saturday night and a 8:pm seating, our guests hadn't arrived, I had time I walked to get baguette. The restaurant could of done this... the food was definitely Okay. The Canolli very good! The check included a 20% gratuity. Not cool as we were five plus one calm kid. Run and staffed by the cute Italian owner and her daughter(s). Not motivated or professionals. When the owner was showed the rock which was larger than a quail egg her response was ""no, no that's not a rock it's not possible to notice these in with the clams"" and after we ordered the Cozze & Vongole apps we we told they were out of Mussels. I don't know but I think Carmine Smeraldo would of thrown a fit of epic proportions, If he were in our place! We were cool about it all but it seemed the staff just wasn't into it.","Joe C.","I moved to Magnolia very recently and have been already been to Mondello twice. The food fabulous - very authentic Northern Italian pasta (i believe all handmade) with good veggie options (important for me).
Not only is food yummy, but the setting is wonderful, with outdoor seating on sidewalk of quiet street.
Best place in Magnolia for a delish meal in European setting..."
"Via Tribunali - Capitol Hill","https://www.yelp.com/biz/via-tribunali-capitol-hill-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cheri M.","Delicious pizza. One of my favorite places in Capital Hill. The staff and the atmosphere are lovely and the location can't be beat especially if you are going to listen to music around the corner. I have been here 3 times and it has been great every time.","Joe R.","I was very close to giving this restaurant a 4* rating simply on the meal I had and the flavor and quality of it push even better to a 5* but just a few things that happened along the course of my meal warranted the setback.
Let me say the Via Tribunali is a warm and cozy restaurant. Almost hard to spot from the street at night, it's got a low profile front entrance so I see it as really a restaurant more frequented by locals than perhaps maybe those of us from out of town. I was craving some local Italian food and did my research on Yelp and also checked out Open Table and decided to give Via Tribunali a try.
I dined alone that night and upon entering was greeted by a gal who was working behind the bar. I was hoping to sit at a table, but she quickly offered me a high top table in the bar area and since I was alone, I really didn't make a big deal of it but the barstool was a bit uncomfortable to sit at (honestly).
A male server came over to me with the menu and he seemed friendly (but did not catch his name - if he said it I missed it completely and it was not on my check when I paid (so can't relay that to you now in my review).
The menu had some very interesting selections, but I was really in the mood for some pasta and saw Rigatoni Bolognese (Giuseppe Cocco rigatoni giganti pasta, house made bolognese, grana padano - cheese) on the menu and that sounded really good! I gotta tell you this dish took me right back to Naples in Italy - authentic flavor and jumbo pasta cooked perfectly. The portion was just the right size too!
I was hoping to start with a soup or dinner side salad but neither option are on the menu, even though there were three salad options on the menu they all seemed to be entrée sized so I opted out. It would be nice for this restaurant to consider adding a small side salad or soup to their menu (as I bet they would be great) Also, no bread was served with the entrée which I found unusual for and Italian, so with a glass of the Villa Travignoli Chianti Rufina Toscana my meal was complete.","Khanh N.","Came here on a Friday night maybe around 8 o'clock. We opted for the bar. There were three high tops available so we chose one. Two other couples came in after us and sat at the other two. We were the last to be greeted by the server and it was not busy in there at all. But whatever, I guess it's fine. Service in there just seemed slow.
I was excited for this pizza! It was sadly, underwhelming. It was extremely soft and floppu so everything slipped and slid right off. I think it was undercooked, idk.
It is a cute intimate vibe for a date night and there are a ton of pizza options. I'd be willing to give this place another shot in hopes of better service and less pizza flop.","Jenny C.","It's been two years since I've last come here and sadly it's not good anymore. The service was mediocre. I had to ask for everything by flagging whichever unfortunate soul was walking by.
The pizzas were nowhere near as good as I remembered. Do you notice all the black spots on the crust of the pizza? Basically, the crust is getting too burnt and the rest of the dough feels a little undercooked. My toppings were sliding off from trying to pick up a slice. I reviewed my old photos of the pizza here and it was not like this. They have changed both the crust and baking method for the worst.
I will look for a better Neopolitan pizza place we elsewhere.","Brian F.","Amazing food in an amazing atmosphere! Apparently it used to be an auto shop. I came on a Saturday evening at 8pm for a party of three and it was not too busy but I'd recommend making a reservation ahead of time especially for larger parties. There's a bigger table in the back of the restaurant that can be sectioned off.
I ordered the Negroni and old fashioned and both were strong and great.
BURRATA DI CAMPANIA ($16) - Oh man the mozzarella cheese was just amazing and went well with the roasted tomatoes. 4/5
POLPETTE AL POMODORO ($14) - These veal meatballs were delicious! There are only two pieces but they are huge. They are cooked in a nice sauce and topped with cheese. 5/5
MARGHERITA ($15) - Again, the cheese was amazing and just made this dish. There were only a couple of basil pieces on top which I was a little bummed about but it was still very good. They're cooked in a wood oven. I'd want to try one of their meat pizzas next. 4/5
TIRAMISU ($9) - I was full but still had room for dessert. It was light and moist and just perfect. 5/5
The service was great! I ordered an old fashioned which was amazing and slightly sweet, and when we ordered a second one the waiter said that they had a different type of whiskey and our next round was equally delicious but it was more smokey.","Schyler P.","If you appreciate amazing pizza dough/crust, you MUST come here.
This was one of the only places open in the area during the snowstorm. I'm so happy it was because I had been wanting to try this place forever and it certainly lived up to (even exceeded??) my expectations. Such amazing pizza (comparable and even BETTER in many cases than pizza I've even had in ITALY!). The service was also amazing. Our server was really friendly and she even RUSHED OUT into the snow after we left to hand us our to-go box we had forgotten at the table. What a SAINT!
5 of us came in and got 3 pizzas + 1 calzone. We got two that were recommended by our server (Dante and Fratelli di Bufala) and then also the Salsiccia e Friarielli. All of them were made of the same amazing dough that was crispy on the outside and CHEWY on the inside. The tomato sauces were killer. So flavorful and just the right amounts of it. I liked all three pizzas we got, but I think my favorite was the Dante for those bursting tomatoes, prosciutto, and arugula. I loved them all though, I don't think you can go wrong with the pizza choice. The via tribunali calzone that we got was pretty good, but not a classic calzone that you'd think of -- it had a lot of spinach in it and had no sauce, only cheese. Still really good though! This is also one of those places that has you cut up the pizza yourself with scissors. I am all about that!
The space itself is cute and has a nice vibe with candles and nice music. I will absolutely be back!","Amanda S.","I'm am deeply saddened and still grieving over the changes that have occurred at my beloved pizza place. Let me walk you through what I experienced.
Arrived late night on a Saturday hoping to get some late night Happy Hour pizza and cheap wine. The restaurant was surprisingly empty. Which is weird because usually it's full. OK, count our blessings that we don't have to wait. Stood at the door for about 5 minutes, made eye contact with staff at the bar but no help. Notice sign says ""please wait to be seated"". Finally after waiting for around 5 min in that area (it's a long time if you really think about standing in an almost empty place on a busy night) we finally waved at the bar staff and asked if we could be seated or should we seat ourselves. She got the attention of the wait staff who was in plan sight but chatting with the cook who came over and finally seated us.
Fine. Whatever.
We sit down and ask for the Happy Hour menu. Ruh Roh. They don't do happy hour anymore.
Fine.
I'll order from the normal menu. It's been a while since we have been here anyways and I was craving some tasty pizza. We put in our order of two pizzas and clams. As we are waiting we realize that the waiter and the two cooks are pretty much chatting and playing around in the dining and kitchen area which is open to the dining area. It's not a big deal but it sure changes the atmosphere. What was once classy and posh ... Well it's not that anymore. Especially since one of the cooks (male) was wearing a white t shirt that was stained and didn't actually cover his belly. In contrast to the uniform outfits they used to wear.
OK fine. Nbd. Who cares.
It was only till I saw this dude chugging wine and making my pizza after rubbing his belly and only wiping his hand on a dirty rag did I really get irritated. This used to be a really nice date night spot for me and the bf..... Furthermore, our food took forever because (and I say this because I had nothing better to do but watch) the two cooks were messing around the entire time even yelling across the restaurant to the wait staff dude.
Yeah. I'm freaking sad but this place is absolute poop as of 2019 and I doubt I will ever go there again.","Jake S.","Did not like the prosciutto pizza. Maybe it's a Seattle thing but it tasted very bland. The decor is nice though and making reservations is easy.","Andrew S.","Saw the sign for VPN certification and was so excited! Unfortunately, this place has some kind of sewage/cleaning/I dunno what problem. It stunk to nine hells. No one should be allowed to sit in such a toxic environment.
Our sense of taste relies so much in our sense of smell that they are inseparable. Even if we could somehow stomach the overriding scent of sewage long enough to attempt to eat, I highly doubt we'd be able to even remotely attempt to enjoy what might otherwise be a good pie that deserves a fork and knife.
This place might be worth it. The tables that were in front of the wide open windows were reserved. Maybe those people know the secret that others may not, this could be secretly delicious. But holy shit, who would ever eat with the smell of raw sewage overpowering every other sense?","Los P.","This is a retrospective review from an experience we had about a year ago. Looking through my phone I found these photos of this amazing pizza we had and thought I'd mention it.
We were working next door at Neumos and with downtime before the show we went on a ""hunt"" for the nearest clam pizza, which ended up being right next to us here at Via Tribunali; we glanced at the menu while smoking spliffs outside. We got our fancy clam pizza togo and ate it dirty style in a small underground greenroom. We inhaled it but i do remember everything about it being perfect: crust, sauce, cheese, & clams.
Sure the box it came in was mad problematic, but hilarious at the same time. I'm sure the boys in the greenroom after us got a kick out of it. I only wish they'd objectify men the same way and have a buff man with a substantial bulge protruding from his tight pants, holding a pie :)","Peter D.","This is a really nice restaurant and its really cool inside. However I have to say the pizza's were not great. Good but not amazing. I wanted to love it but the first thing I noticed is that our two pizzas were not the same consistency. One was perfectly round and the toppings were relatively consistent across while the other was all weirdly misshapen with toppings erratically thrown around so that not all bites were equal. Some had toppings, others nothing. Even worse it looked like a child made it and for $18 that is just not right. I also don't care for the scissors to cut the pizza myself. I prefer it cut before being delivered especially considering its damn hot. Flavors were good but I just cant get over the one pizza (carbonara) being so poorly made. Also I am not a fan of chili infused olive oil. At least warn us my poor wife was dying. Service was good but not much was explained about anything such as the spicy olive oil vs the other on the table we didn't even realize was there. For the price, I would rather go to Tutta Bella. Great crust though. The place has potential but my first experience was a let down.","Jessica H.","My favorite pizza and an always friendly wait staff. A reliable go-to for slightly more fancy than usual pizza night!","Emily L.","We ordered delivery. This is the box it came in. It is disgusting. They can keep objectifying women, we won't be supporting their business though.","Catherine E.","Wow!!!! Absolutely amazing food! I grew up in Italy when I was younger and the pasta brought back so many memories of family dinners we used to have. We had the rigatoni and the four season pizza, my husband finished mine since he couldn't keep his darn hands out of it lol.
Atmosphere is awesome, however, the music did not match the decor and feel of the place, but that's not a biggie. We're from Hawaii and found this place on yelp, we're extremely happy we came and will most definitely be returning!!!!
A+++++ for food and atmosphere","Nicholas P.","I came here for a date. The ambient atmosphere will immediately draw you inside. The staff are professional and well dressed. I appreciate this because it's nice to go out and enter a place where the dress code matches the customer attire. We were seated quickly. The food was clearly homemade and delicious. I didn't get a typical pizza/Italian food American-vibe. It was definitely very authentic.
Basically this place was so good I brought my mom when she flew into town and she was impressed (that's hard to do by the way). I definitely recommend coming here!!!
I have had three different types of pizza, a calzone, and one pasta dish. All get a 10/10 for flavor, freshness, presentation.","Elizabeth C.","I could cry it was so good. We had lived in Italy for almost 3 years and this was the closest the pizza has come to what we would eat there. True Italian choices for food and drink. Was absolutely amazing!","Stormy K.","Came on a Friday night at 730 was greeted immediately and took 12 minutes (out of the 20 quoted) to get sat.
Food was prompt and AMAZING!!!
And our server Carly was so cute. Despite being so busy she was kind and approachable and so attentive!
This place was great.","Dedra C.","Pizza was amazing, service was awesome!! We had the 3rd Pizza on the menu I can't remember the name and a Caesar salad. Really impressed with the authentic Italian Pizza! I wish I would of took pics.","Sheena N.","Came here on a Friday night at around 8:30pm. We called ahead thinking there would be a wait but there were still a couple available tables.
They have an extensive wine list with 8 or 9 wines you can get by the glass and the rest are all bottles. One thing to note is that at least for the red wine they serve it in a weird looking glass. The server proudly told us that its the same glasses that are used in Italy when we asked why we didn't get ""normal"" wine glasses lol.
We ordered 3 pizzas for 3 people because our server told us the pizzas are super thin. He was totally right... they were thin to the point where they provided scissors for you to cut through it if you wanted to.
I ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza since I love mushrooms and salame on my pizza. You can definitely taste the quality of the ingredients. The tomato sauce they use is not from canned tomatoes and gives a very light fresh burst of flavor that compliments the saltiness of the salami and prosciutto. The fresh mozzarella was not heavy at all as it can be with pizza that is overloaded with cheese (this was not). The crust was crispy and light. The pizza was so delicious, I love how it didn't put me into a food coma afterward. Btw, cut your pizza into small slices so your toppings dont slide off onto your face when you eat it :)
They also give you fresh grated parmesan and red chilli flake if you need it.","Amir B.","Come on now. There's no contest here. This is the best pie in Seattle. I've sampled them all and this place has the best dough with perfect char, authentic sauce, and truly wonderful staff.
I would recommend the pies to be taken to the face immediately (I.e. in the restaurant or promptly right outside when getting takeout) as the key to its delicious nature comes from eating it fresh.
This is authentic pizza: not some overly greasy, obnoxiously cheesy with fructose-ridden sauce. Don't fall victim to the (few) negative reviews and envelop yourself in pizza paradise!"
"That’s Amore! Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/thats-amore-italian-cafe-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Matthew R.","I first heard about this restaurant through the Lyft Podcast - Pick me Up on my commute home to Seattle from Bellevue. It was a great story of how the current owner came to own the restaurant after the original one relocated to Kentucky.
This single podcast influenced my dinner choice that evening and we came from our place in Downtown Seattle and really enjoyed the food.
This place has much charm and the new owners Guy and David are great hosts and have a great team behind them.
I've had everything from scallops to chicken fettucini alfredo to wild boar ragu and more. I'm primarily and old world wine fan and apprecite their selection.
Fast forward to now, we live in the Mount Baker neighborhood and go about every three months and things are consistenly great and we've brought many out of town visitors here over time.
Whether you live in the neighborhood or outside, it's a great gathering for friends or family!","Briana N.","I always drive past this place.... Didn't realize how popular it was.
I ordered the Ragù alla Bologna which is a meat sauce with wide, thick noodles. The sauce was very flavorful.. had a strong meat taste.. more so than a marinara taste. The pasts was garnished very lovely. They also give you bread while you're waiting....
I ordered a red wine which paired perfectly with my meal but forgot the name. Our server was very helpful with recommendations..
This restaurant has a great view of downtown but it's pretty crowded on Saturday's, so making a reservation might be helpful.","Jessica N.","Best part about this restaurant is how warm and friendly it is. First time trying it out and the owners treated us like family. Made the dining experience in a cute neighborhood spot that much more enjoyable.
Food was also great! Favorite dish was the prawn and scallops saffron pasta. Expensive but worth it. Comes with two huge prawns that's are To. Die. For. Bolognese pasta was the other main dish we got... unique dish with a burst of flavor, but wasn't my personal favorite. Caesar salad was a nice way to start off our meal. Not overly dressed but still had lots of flavor... beware of garlic!
Tiramisu for dinner was creamy but very good. And the pistachio gelato with chunks is pistachios in it was another hit. I'll definitely be back!","E H.","My husband and I had dinner here last night and I'm sorry we haven't been there much more often! The owner seated us next to the back windows where the unexpected view into downtown Seattle was so spectacular! We started with the bruschetta, it was good. He ordered the saltimbocca tortellini special, I ordered the bologne ragu pasta. Both were so delicious.
Try this place, you'll love it! Support our
small locally owned businesses!","Samantha G.","Love this place! Service and food are fantastic. Adorable little place overlooking the city. Great spot to go for birthday! My husband took me here and in the reservation happened to say it was my birthday. They gave us the best service and were so kind!! Moved us closer to the window with the great view! Also the food was so tasty! They serve homemade bread and we got the risotto cakes which were amazing. The special was crab with parpidelle pasta was wonderful!!! Defn check it out!","Carol B.","Our favorite neighborhood restaurant! My partner and I live in the area and have to try not to come here every weekend. This is our go to spot when guests are in town. You can't beat the delicious food, quality wine, great views, and kind service. I don't think I need to say anymore, but I will.
Food: Superb Italian food. I've been here enough times to try much of the menu. You can't go wrong with the daily Tortellone. When I last visited it was filled with short rib and tasted perfect. I've also enjoyed their NY strip steak and Wild Boar Ragu. Typically I don't get appetizers because otherwise I get way too full, but their bruschetta is nice and refreshing when I do. Portions are reasonable but I almost always have leftovers to take home, just so I can save room for tiramisu. Honestly, I would come here exclusively for desert. The tiramisu is perfect in my eyes. It is rich and full of flavor.
Wine: Wonderful selection of quality wine. We always stick to reds and take the waiter's recommendations which we never regret.
Atmosphere: It's a beautiful view of the downtown Seattle skyline with the mountains in the background. The restaurant is on the smaller side so I always make a reservation, but I don't think one is always necessary.
Parking: limited street parking, but its always free.","Amanda J.","Sweet little place w nice big windows. Complimentary bread w oil & balsamic vinegar.
The spinach risotto was delicious, the presentation was beautiful. The key lime cheesecake presentation is very cute & tasted pretty good. Service was attentive & genuine.","Kate A.","This place was okay. It was cute ambience tucked away with a pretty nice view in the back. We waited quite a while for our food so we filled up on bread because we were hungry. The bread was good, salad was good, pasta was ok. My friend ordered a seafood dish and it was extremely fishy.. didn't seem very fresh but wasn't inedible. I had the bolognese which was fine. Staff was very nice although one waiter was spread pretty thin amongst all the tables.","Priyanshu J.","We have been to That's Amore twice. Our first visit was on valentine's day 2016 and the next one was on our anniversary in 2019. Both times, we have left with smile on our faces.
The service here is top notch! Everyone at the restaurant is friendly and go above & beyond to make your visit special. On oyr anniversary, not only we had the best table with an incredible view of Seattle skyline, we were presented with a beautiful handmade card that we are going to keep forever. We felt special and it totally made our day.
Coming to food, it was amazing in both our visits. The bread served is one of the best breads we have had (and do try the vinegar, it has incredible flavor). We also tried the Risotto cakes for appetizer which were really good.
But, the star of the show was the pasta with chicken and spinach in white sauce. The sauce was amazing and in perfect quantity, so was the pasta and chicken. One of the best pastas we have had!
F8nally, the tiramisu was excellent as well. We would love going back for our next date night!","Leina K.","My bf heard about this place on a Lyft podcast when the owner was trying to raise money to buy this place from the previous owner. And, I'm glad he did!
There are so many Italian places near us downtown but we are more than happy to make the trek to Mt. Baker. In the past 6 weeks or so, we've gone 3 times, had different dishes each time, and all of them were amazing.
We were lucky enough to be there for NYE when other plans fell through. They did a toast with champagne with everyone in the restaurant and it couldn't have been a better way to end 2018. We will definitely be back!","Earnie G.","I promised in my previous review to visit again and update my review. Here's the update. and it's good news. New owner. New chef. New passion.
Longtime That's Amore! server, Guy Devillier, bought the restaurant recently (started in March). A new chef, Richard Holdridge, was put in place in July. And the changes are positive.
On this visit, I tried the wild boar ragù. It was tasty. The seasoning was unique and bold, and the flavors complemented each other. The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente. My only complaint was the hamburger texture of the wild boar meat. More on that in a minute.
I also tried the flourless chocolate torte for dessert. Another winner. Dark and deep chocolate flavor in a dense torte. Sounds like about half the desserts are made in house now. And the others are made by ""a retired baker who makes them just for us,"" according to my helpful server, Cindy. I'd still prefer all the desserts be made in house. Hopefully, they will get there eventually.
Cindy was an excellent server. She was informed, friendly, and helpful. I asked her to recommend the best dish on the menu, and that's how I ended up with the wild boar ragù.
I chatted with Guy after my meal, and I was impressed by his passion and love for this place. For example, we spoke about the boar ragù. He brought it up and mentioned they were thinking about making the meat larger pieces instead of the hamburger texture because the wild boar was too good a meat to make it into hamburger. I shared that I agreed and thought a pulled pork kind of texture would be great. It will be fun to see where the dish goes.
Which means, I will be back. This was a good experience this time, and I feel good about spending some of my dining money here. The passion's back, so please visit and fan the flames.","Alane G.","If you're looking for a great view, awesome service, and yummy food. This is the place you want to be! They have specials I believe daily if not weekly. The server will let you know and explain each special dish that they're serving you. They will also offer you wine or a beverage to match your dish of your choosing.
From the Mt. Baker area, you can see pretty skies and some parts of the city! I ordered the Lasagna and it was delicious. The red sauce was well seasoned and put together. I went with my family, it was my cousins birthday and they can accommodate group sizes. I would call in advanced because this place is not that small, however if it's packed you'd have to wait. I'd come again to dine.","Mike N.","The high Yelp rating attracted us to this neighborhood Italian restaurant. Nothing fancy inside which I'm driven to. They have a mostly Italian wine list. Took us a few tastes to find something we liked. Started with the Caprese Salad. This was the best part of the meal. Heirloom tomatoes, grilled eggplant, mozzarella. Everything fresh and a good sized serving for $12. The entrees were mostly pasta and started at $20. Had the Risotto Florentine. Spinach risotto with three large shrimp. The dish was smaller than I imagined as it was $26. To be honest, it was average at best. While the shrimp were good, the rest of the dish was bland and left me still hungry. We decided to skip the dessert after be underwhelmed at dinner. Possibly, I ordered the wrong dish? Maybe should have gone for pasta. Service was good but he never stopped back by to see if we enjoyed our meal. Guess he knew the answer.","The T.","I went to That's Amore on Christmas Eve and it was a great experience. We had a pretty early reservation so there was only one other group there. It got much busier as we stayed there and all the tables were filled when we left. The service was great and the waiter was nice. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and a raspberry Italian soda. I would give it a 5 star rating but my sisters meatballs came out too red in the middle. Great experience at that's Amore would recommend to anyone. Also the view of Seattle is amazing.","Carolyn A.","What a wonderful surprise!!
We were able to get a last minute reservation on a busy weekend night and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. They offered options for the children in our party, had a wonderful selection of wines to pair with every dish and an amazing view of the city.
Dylan was our server and he was such a delight, friendly and extremely knowledgeable with regard to the menu. Everyone was very happy with their dinner and we all are looking forward to trying something new the next time we are in the neighborhood!","Adam P.","A true neighborhood restaurant, that's worth traveling far outside your neighborhood for.
To simply call this an ""old school"" Italian restaurant doesn't do it justice. It is old school in classic, sophisticated, but unpretentious setting. Even more so in the service, and how the owner and wait staff will treat you like you're an old friend of theirs who has been frequenting the spot for years even if it's your first time walking in.
But the food is something else entirely. Not only do they nail the classics (including the best chicken piccata you ever tasted), they're inventive enough to keep up up with any Cap Hill or Downtown joint you see on a Seattle Times best of list. Try their wild boar ragu if you want a perfect example.
Exceptional restaurant. Can't recommend enough.","Carol Y.","WORST Italian food EVER, I regret selecting this restaurant for an important occasion.
It wasn't just me, every single person in my party was extremely disappointed with the food, including my parents visiting Seattle from another country, my bf who was meeting my parents for the first time, and my bf's sister, brother in law and little niece who drove all the way from Olympia. Yes we had a big table by the window and appreciated the nice view of the Seattle skyline, and yes our service staff was friendly and helpful, but none of that helped when the food sucked.
Look at my photos of the dishes, great presentation and plating right? That's what I thought too! And I couldn't wait to put the food in my mouth! But after I did my heart sank, and everyone saw my smile turned into frown. WTH? The wild boar was supposed to be slow cooked and tender but mine tasted like rubber. And no seasoning?? The risotto was hard and smelled funny (we suspected melted goat cheese was used in the sauce which wasn't listed on the menu), the chicken on top was again lack of seasoning, how do you call that a ""special""? I call it specially bad. And don't even get me started on the fettuccine dish, the feedback was that there was no trace of cheese which was supposed to be an important ingredient. Who was cooking for us exactly? Some intern chef? Ugh. I'm getting upset again as I'm writing this review, I could have picked any other place in the city and I'm sure it wouldn't have ruined a special night. Oh the bill wasn't cheap either.
Two lessons learned: 1) Trying a new restaurant is always risky, don't do it when you have an important occasion. 2) Good yelp rating doesn't always guarantee a good experience","Michelle S.","This is probably one of my favorite Italian restaurants... I mean the pasta, guys! The noodles are thin, nothing I've ever seen before. We found this hidden gem recommended by my boyfriend's friend. It was at the very top of Rainier in south Seattle. Such a cute, small little restaurant and if you're lucky like we were (twice), we got a seat next to the window with an amazing view of the space needle.
Easy to find street parking(free). No reservations needed. I got the pasta shrimp carbonara that was soooo good. This was our second time here and I am already dreaming about coming back more often. Seriously the pasta noodles are what makes this restaurant different. My boyfriend and I have found our favorite go-to for delicious Italian food. Our server was nothing short of sweet. Definitely recommend. We also left both our plates empty. No leftovers when it comes to us.","Linh T.","My boyfriend and I have been here twice. The first time right after we moved to Mt Baker and was looking for a local date night spot and the second time we came here right before our marathon to carb up. Both of the times we got top notch service and the food is amaaaazing.
The first time we went here was before they changed their menu and the old menu definitely looked more like typical, classic family-style Italian restaurant whereas the new menu seems more modern, but they did keep lots of their old specialty dishes on the new menu. This time around i ordered the fruiti di mare - the scallops were perfectly cooked and noodles so al dente! We always finish with dessert, and the flourless chocolate cake is seriously to die for!!","Noelle B.","We came here because of all the 5-star reviews. Staff was very nice, but the food was...odd, especially given how much love this place gets. The sauce on the lasagna was overly sweet, which took over the dish. My Florentine risotto was an unusually small portion of risotto that was blandly flavored. The presentation was pretty, with three large shrimp and an orchid on top, but not enough to justify the price tag. The chicken piccata sauce was creamy, which is another odd choice for a traditional dish. The Alfredo was good, but our server forgot to add the shrimp, meanining it arrived 5 minutes later on a side plate looking somewhat sad and dejected, with no presentation. (She said it was coming whne I asked her, but then I watched her go and order it from the screen. At least she didn't charge us for it.) Finally, this place is really, really loud when it's full. It was really hard for all of us to hear our conversation by the end of our meal.
I'm glad this is a nice neighborhood joint for the locals, but we came from a ways away because of the reviews. We won't make the trip back again."
"Bar Cotto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cotto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jill V.","I went to this restaurant with a group of 9 last night. The service was excellent and the food was wonderful. We had a wide range of tastes in our group, and there was definitely something for everybody. And, everyone loved their food. We were there in time to order some items from the Happy Hour food menu... great options there for good prices. And, they had good drink specials on that menu as well.
It is a small, comfortable atmosphere. We made reservations for our large party and accommodated us perfectly. The restaurant wasn't too noisy, so we could hear a conversation across the table. Thank you Bar Cotto, we will be back.","jill g.","I'm going to start with the bad. I go into this restaurant thinking to myself... ""I'm just going to have a small salad or the brussels sprouts"" and I end up eating enough to feet a large village of small people. Or a small village of large people. I always get those mixed up.
The good...ZOMG. the food. I don't even know where to start? The brussels sprouts are so good that they kind of defy reason. The pizzas are outstanding, I especially love the mushroom pizza with a hint of truffle oil. The salads are spectacular, and don't even get me started on the buffalo mozzarella with marinated tomatoes on the side. The rigatoni is rich and flavorful and chock full of meat and sauce and maybe magic. And really don't get me started on the desserts because I've already got 2 pants sizes since I started writing this review.
And the bar/drinks? divine.
portions are generous. prices are fair. service is outstanding. worth the trek every time.","Lura N.","I feel very lucky that Bar Cotto is across the street from my new apartment.
After moving in, my boyfriend and I wanted something quick and inexpensive. Bar Cotto has a great happy hour from 9pm-closing which worked out perfectly.
I ordered the gnocchi because I am a pasta lover, and I was not disappointed. It is amazing and I've already gone back to have it again. I also thoroughly enjoyed the caesar salad. My boyfriend loves pizza in general and definitely enjoyed the pizzas we have tried so far.
You can't really go wrong with the happy hour menu overall, especially the bottles of wine!","Mia C.","This review is just based on happy hour. We came on a Sunday night with 4 ladies. The staff was welcoming right away, and gave us their happy hour specials. The bottle of wine is a great deal, though not the best wine. We also ordered the gnocchi, which was creamy and amazing. The bread is more like a pizza dough and not a bread, but it went well with the prosciutto we ordered. I would say this is a good place for parties of 2-6, and I would come during happy hour -- but probably not pay their full price outside those times. Friendly staff and good italian food.","Daniel L.","Came here for happy hour on a weekday. The happy hour here is fantastic! They have great prices and decent sized portions. You can get full and drunk here on happy hour for a good price. And the food is delicious (we especially liked the gnocchi). The personal pizza was alright (would recommend the pasta/meatballs more).","Anusha B.","Lovely food, great service. Came here on a Friday evening pretty late. The place was packed but the host accommodated us outside while we waited for our table.
We realized it was happy hour when we reached. The food portions for happy hour were pretty big. Loved the burrata, bruschetta, Funghi pizza and clam pasta. The dessert was great too. I'll be visiting this again soon.","Ellerey N.","I love bar Cotto! They have a great happy hour too with very reasonably priced dishes. Their pizza is amazing. I love their rendition of a margarita pizza. One of my favorite things is their freshly sliced prosciutto and salamis. So good! This is one of my go to spots in the neighborhood.","Ellen B.","I've been to Bar Cotto a couple times with friends. Yelp has listed ""not recommended for large groups"" and I definitely agree- but that hasn't stopped our friends from choosing Bar Cotto. They always do their best to accommodate, but it can be a little bit of a wait.
I had the Night in Parma and enjoyed my drink- although I think it was a little light on the alcohol. My boyfriend had two cocktails that were heavy on the alcohol so I'm not sure about the consistency of experiences here.
It's a nice cozy place that we've enjoyed eating/grabbing a drink at. It's classier and not as grungy as most of the bars lower on the hill. I don't like pizza (weird I know), but I find Bar Cotto's pizza some of the preferable kind. It's not overly greasy or cheesy and I like the unique toppings.
My favorite here is the Brussels sprouts though. I don't like Brussels sprouts at all, but something about these actually made me unable to stop eating them! I've also tried the meatballs and would stay away (kind of bland and flavorless). Their appetizers are a little on the pricey side, but I think their pizzas/pastas are pretty reasonably priced for the amount you can get and share.
Overall I've had great experiences here and would recommend it if you're in the area. I'm not sure I'd recommend walking all the way up the hill for Bar Cotto from the main downtown area, but it's a great stop if you're headed that way anyways.","Angela Y.","A decent place for some Neapolitan style pizza. I got the mushroom pizza and a beet salad. The pizza had truffle oil on it and the truffle flavor comes through pretty well. I'd want to come back and try something with the red sauce though. The beet salad was also good with pistachios, greens and goat cheese.","Wendy K.","Dropped in here before a chef's table event at Adana called Eat with your Eyes with local artist Dozfy. I loved the staff here friendly and helpful. When I said We probably weren't going to eat cause we were dining across the street our waiter didn't make me feel guilty. In reality we ordered a couple items off the HH menu not certain what portions size we would have at dinner. Our waiter said they had a great relationship with Adana and he was excited for us to try their food.
When my cousin found the drink she ordered wasn't quite to her liking the waiter didn't hesitate to say he'd have something else made instead, she was much happier with second drink. We definitely will come back for drinks and pizza we saw the pizza at another table looked delicious","Camille W.","So glad I finally got to try this place out. Holy moly it is amazing. We came around 8:30 on a Wednesday night & it was pretty mellow and felt cozy. It was a casual weeknight and I recommend coming around happy hour as it can be pricey. Perfect place for date night - they have the ambience with the candle at the table and mood lighting on point. Their menu has antipasti, plenty of pizza options, pasta, and a full bar.
My hubby ordered an old fashioned and myself a house red. Both drinks were superb. I wish I could've watched our server make the drink. It was smooth, a little sweet, and cold. They used a black cherry, which I found to be neat as I've never seen that being incorporated into an old fashioned cocktail.
Our pizza choice was the funghi - essentially a mushroom pizza. If I could get this again I would! It was delicious! Sooo cheesey, mushrooms were cooked perfectly (tender and just the right amount of oil), and some basil leaves on top. The crust was the perfect balance, chewy, but crispy by the crust, with just the right amount of char. The pizza comes out with chili oil and red pepper flakes. I'm assuming the chili oil is Calabrian chili oil which made the dish extra spicy. So good. We are pizza snobs and enjoy a good wood fired pizza and so glad this is just a few blocks away from our place. I can't wait to come for HH and try more!","Shiny P.","If you want yummy Italian foods, real pizza, this is the place to be! Ambience is great, food is great, and price point is great too.","Amy L.","Not bad pizza v good actually. Just missed happy hour so don't know how good drinks r but we got the rotating house wine and it was just v ok. Twist off lol so not much to expect. V cool atmosphere. I liked the pizza! Would come back again sometime. Nice waiter/bartender. Yums. The sausage one idk what it was called but it yummy. I like margarita too. Happy times. Pizza 13 inches about so split between 3 people pretty good portion. Open view of kitchen and that fire oven","Kendra S.","Revisited Bar Cotto for dinner tonight. Ordered the Salsiccia Pizza, Ceasar Salad, Meatballs & wine. The 1st wine was a recommendation from the server, which was a white burgundy that went well with all of the food.
The pizza was amazing and might possibly be my new favorite Neoploitan style pizza on Capitol Hill. The meatballs were so zesty #loved. The Ceasar Salad could have been passed on. It was overly drenched in dressing.
The service was great. Had the opportunity to have a lovely chat with Brandon the owner and I will be back.
To reiterate I loved how zesty the tomatoes sauce was on the meatballs and pizza. So many places have bland tomatoe sauces and that's no concern here.","Rose S.","This is the best neighborhood Italian place in all of Capital Hill, maybe even Seattle.
Small, intimate seating, fantastic happy hour and food that make me swoon! Never had a bad dish. Favorites are the burrata and fried dough bites. Happy hour til 6:30!","Karyn J.","The pizza is so delicious! And the burrata antipasto is just to die for. The service was at just the perfect mix of attentiveness and allowing for private conversations at the bar. Such a great small neighborhood spot","Elizabeth C.","I didn't even know this was an Ethan Stowell joint before coming here but as an ESR fan I'm so glad we decided to try this place! It was kind of on a whim, after a long drawn out conversation about where to go for dinner, we remembered there was that pizza place around the corner we'd mentioned wanting to try.
We just missed happy hour, unfortunately, as the HH prices are really solid and the regular menu is a bit on the pricey side.
We each got a cocktail (midnight in Parma for me, love the gin/lambrusco combo), then bruschetta for apps, and two pizzas (the A&O and the funghi).
Cocktail was great, just what I needed after a long day. The pizza was really nice, love that thin, tasty crust. The funghi is very subtly truffle-y, just the right amount. Honestly, though, the bruschetta was banging and I'd come back just to eat that.
That amount of food was perfect for two hungry people and the service here is nice, too. Ambiance is perfect for a date night as well.","Dave B.","Eat here before the guy whose job it is to put crack in everything they serve is locked up. Omigod the food is so good I'm going to need grief therapy when I'm forced to to leave. 10/10 recommend ... or 5 staRs. Whatever the metric is. Get on the next Southwest flight and eat this food.","Audrey O.","Wow. Just wow. Not only did I have an amazing experience, but Brandon served me the perfect wine I requested each time. We savored the gnocchi, margharita pizza, Cesar salad, and olives. I also LOVED the playlist and having a conversation at the bar with several guests. Fantastic late night happy hour deals that were filling, fantastic aesthetic, and quality of drinks, food, and service. 10/10.","Ly T.","It's more like 3.5 stars. Another one of Ethan's restaurants. Had a couple bottles of wine and cocktails. If you go to Rione for their happy hour, bottles of wines are only $20... here it is $4 more. :(
Their sides here: salad and charred broccoli were underdressed and small portioned.
Pizzas: the anchovy pizza was great; crispy and chewy; good balance. The pepperoni was wet and soggy in the middle of the pie. The dough couldn't hold the wet sauce well.
Service: cool guys working here... very attentive and friendly."
"Bar Del Corso","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-del-corso-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lawrence P.","Superlative experience, from the hostess, wait staff and food.
My girlfriend friend and I are pretty and snobby about our Italian food (being from the NY area). This place does not need to be graded on a curve.
We shared the arugula salad, suppli, burata, and clams. Maybe one dish too many but would not have been able to skip any of them in retrospect. And to make my gluttony worse, I could not get the ""polenta cake with gold pear"" from the dessert board off of my mind...so I indulged. I rarely order dessert but am so happy I did...tears of joy well up remembering it.
Well-seasoned food - rich where called for, appropriately spiced, etc.
ThIs was our thIrd or fourth time visiting. Always solid (hence the return trips) but this night was absolutely next level.","Candace H.","Bar Del Corso is a hidden gem of Beacon Hill! I can't believe I've driven past this place a bajillion times over 10 year and yet I have not once tried it until now. I came in on a Friday around 6:30pm for a casual date night - we only waited about 5 minutes till we got seated. I was encouraged to find a decent amount of people waiting inside the restaurant! Their interior feels homey and it's bustling with energy. I did find the noise level louder than a normal restaurant, but I liked how energetic the atmosphere felt.
What to order:
-FUNGHI PIZZA: if you're a shroom lover like me, then you'll love this pizza! Mushrooms and sausage! It also comes with pizza scissors so you can cut the slice to the size of your desire. Its wood-fired pizza too. The only little let down was that some bits of the bottom of the pizza was a little burnt. But the flavor on top was still great so I still ate it!
-FRIED RISOTTO BALLS: its got a great crisp, yet piping hot interior with melty mozzarella cheese in the middle. A great small plate to go with your meal!
-ARUGULA PEAR BALSAMIC SALAD: the balance of flavors and textures in this salad was refreshing and delicious. Pears were sweet and the cheese and arugula paired so well with it.
-GRILLED OCTOPUS: so tender and it felt like a mix between italian and spanish flavors. The sauce is delicious so I would be sure to order a side of housemade bread to soak it all up!
We practically finished ALL this food except for half the pizza and the bill was under $55. What a bargain! Service was quick and the server who helped us was attentive and helpful in helping us make our choices. I will for sure come back to try the meatballs and dessert, and give the pizza another go :)","Gigi B.","This place is amazing! Perfect date night spot without breaking the bank. Their pizzas are sublime, made to perfection, they have a very interesting and affordable wine menu, and their desserts are just absolutely divine!!! We had the classic Margherita with a bottle of wine and finished it off with the most amazing, life altering dessert! It was this delicious combination of orange, chocolate and tiramisu! Yumm!!! Definitely a hit! The wait on a weekend can be long, so be ready to put your name down and take a walk around the neighborhood! The wait is definitely worth it!","Naveed N.","Love this place. Fun and friendly atmosphere with good service, food, and drinks to boot. Came on the recommendation of a friend, and have been back twice more for drinks and pizza.
My first experience at Bar Del Corso was April 2018- three of us stopping in for dinner around 7 PM on a weekday evening. The wait was about 10 minutes, and even more painless considering you can order a drink while you wait. I have yet to experience a wait more than 5-10 minutes, but 7/8 is generally also the earliest you'll catch me out for dinner.
Parking is easy on Beacon Ave or in any of the neighborhoods perpendicular. Inside the atmosphere is very much a casual neighborhood bar/cafe vibe, with an open kitchen concept, an open area of seating between wooden beams, as well as seating at the bar. I think this serves well for any occasion whether you're having a quick/casual drink, dinner, or a decent night out in the neighborhood.
The menu is seasonal and simple with a good selection of small plates, salads, cheese/meat, and excellent Neapolitan pizzas! Can't go wrong with their salads/veggies, the Burrata is a fantastic choice, as well as the grilled octopus.
The Pizza... yes. I'd venture to say the pizza here falls confidently in my top 2/3 favorites in Seattle. Perfectly thin and wood-fire charred, the right amount of sauce and cheese, with delicious toppings. The Funghi is a great choice. They also provide you with fun pizza cutting scissors to create your own sized slices.
As for the bar- they generally have a small but good selection of beers on tap, and great cocktails at a fair price. I've been more than happy with the Aperol Spritz and Negroni here.
All things considered, Bar Del Corso hits high on every cylinder. It is convenient to get to and park, wait times aren't crazy, boasts a fun and friendly atmosphere for any occasion, and then there's the pizza.. (insert heart-eyes emoji.) This is one of those reviews that it pains me to write because I don't want it to get more busy and popular but regardless I hope you'll give it a try. Cheers!","Srikanth T.","It gives me no pleasure to say this but Seattle may be one of if not the worst pizza cities in America. The dollar slice spots I've been to don't even know how to operate a business let alone make a decent pizza (seriously if your business closes at 2:30 don't run out of pizza at 1:45 and stop making pizza it's not that complicated). I didn't have high expectations going into Bar Del Corso and my expectations sank when I got there and there was a long wait. On the one hand maybe it's because the pizza was good on the other hand maybe it's because there are like 3 restaurants in Beacon Hill and this was one lol. Anyways when we finally got seated and got our food this place definitely blew me away. The risotto and cheese balls were a great appetizer (they only give 3 in a tray so if you're really hungry order 2 of them) and the pizza itself was exceptional. It's by my count the only Seattle pizza place that exceeds the extremely low bar of being better than a Dominoes (no seriously dominoes might be #2). We ordered the margherita pizza - added tip get the prosciutto on there and cook it, it has a nice crisp to it. There was also a sausage and peppers pizza we got that was also excellent. And as an added bonus the owner is really friendly and does talk to customers. Apparently Megan Rapinoe used to frequent this place and she's real chummy with her, which is kind of a fun fact you can tell your friends about if that's the sort of thing you're into (hey this pizza place I went to Megan rapinoe also went to a lot!). My only negative is the wait is kind of long, but well worth it given that this is the only pizza worth going out of your way to eat in a 300 mile radius (probably).
5 Star Sriview - Megan rapinoe eats here. You wouldn't want to be against her now would you?","Felicia N.","Loved this little gem tucked away in Beacon Hill. We stopped by on a Wednesday night after an afternoon at Alki and didn't have to wait.
The atmosphere is casual and feels like a bustling neighborhood hang out. They have some outdoor seating in the front and the back, perfect for Seattle summers.
We ordered the Salami pizza, Vongole alla marinara, and the Arugula and frisee salad.
Everything was delicious! The pizza was incredibly thin, perfect char, and amazing ingredients. The clams were made with fresh tomatoes and came with the perfect assortment of breads to soak up the yummy sauce in. We were impressed by the salad because we make a very similar one at home... but somehow theirs was ten times better! It was perfectly dressed and balanced and the ingredients were super fresh.
Can't wait to come back to this spot and hopefully get a table outside next time! I'm very happy to support this local business.","Monica S.","One of my favorite pizza spots in Seattle! I've been here multiple times and have always had a positive experience.
They always have quite the crowd and line out the door, but we always manage to get a table in 45 minutes or less. Their menu is very straightforward and the options are good, since I don't like having a million and one options. Service is always on point, and I really enjoy the overall ambiance of the place. One minor thing, was that some of the pizzas tasted burnt to me on our last visit, but I guess that's what you get with a wood fired oven.
With your pizzas, they give you scissors to cut your pizza, and cute containers of chili oil and chili flakes on the side.
I've tried multiple pizzas and other dishes here including:
Burrata and Rapini: yum! great appetizer option that had me feeling light, but still filled us up
Corno Di Capra: one of my favorite pizzas!! delicious!
Rapini: favorite of the veggie options, that is still super hearty
Salame Piccante: good flavor!!
We got a bottle of red as well, and it was recommended to by our server, and a great recommendation it was! Will definitely be coming back in the future!","Kirsten T.","Arrived early for a Saturday dinner and had no trouble getting a table. Ordered a glass of wine for myself and a cider for my spouse. The cider was good but it was the smallest glass of cider I've ever seen served in a restaurant! Re-orders from the bar were very slow to arrive.
The food was really good. Tried two different salads, the rice and mozz balls, a mushroom pizza and a strawberry rhubarb dessert. Loved the salads!
The prices were fair and the service good. Alas, the restaurant is so very loud when full of diners.","Ken V.","First visit revealed a packed restaurant and the promise of a fairly lengthy wait. We decided to order takeout, and were surprised at how quickly the order was prepared while we waited. Three different versions of their pizza...each prepared very well and delicious. Three different salads offered the same results--good sourcing, delicious and balanced flavors.
It may not be fair to judge a ""sit down"" restaurant by the results of a takeout order...but they did a very good job. I look forward to my next visit being a little better planned, with an opportunity to more fully appreciate the restaurant and service.","Christine V.","I came here with my girl friend for a weekend dinner around 7, and it was pretty packed when we got there. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations but you could tell the waitress that you don't mind sitting at the bar, which was what we did and it ended up being around a 40 min wait for us.
The menu consists of small plates to share, salads, some sliced meats, cheeses, and of course, the pizzas! There is not a huge selection of pizzas to choose from, but everything sounded amazing. We were starving and ended up ordering two to share - the funghi and the margherita. Both were so so good! The pizzas were thin, had the perfect char to them, and were not overloaded with ingredients to make them fancy. The simplicity is what really helped highlight the products they use. They also bring you a pair of scissors so you can cut the pizza yourself.
Highly recommend coming here for some good Neapolitan pizza! I can't wait to come back for some more and to try some of their smaller plates also.","Jason P.","My favorite pizza place for Neapolitan style pizza, it has a great casual atmosphere, other great options beside the pizza all at a great price, if only it was open later in the night, but even with that complaint it still a five stars for me.
Bar Del Corso is just a little bit out side of downtown Seattle, on the main street of Beacon Hill, so there is free street parking available. The restaurant itself is nice and open with an interesting art on the walls. There is both bar and table seating, but can get packed in busy times.
The staff is great, they are vary laid back while still attentive. This is a very causal place to eat some great food with friends and it can get pretty loud in here.
The pizza style is Neapolitan, so it thin crust with a nice char on the bottom. There only 6 pizza options on the menu, with maybe a one or two more on the special of the night. All of the options are only a few ingredients so the pizza are fairly simple, but done really well and highlight those ingredients. Beside the pizza, there are various Italian small dishes and vegetables, and cured meats. Like the pizza, they are simple but done really well.","Joop V.","Great option for a nice and a very well priced dinner in Seattle! My friend and I met up for dinner on a weekend and we ordered 4 dish: rapini (with poached egg), arugula and beets salad, grilled octopus and beans, and a Funghi (mushroom and sausage) pizza. We both enjoyed the meal and the ambiance of the restaurant...it was a non pretentious classuc meal yet very casuso enough that you feel so comfortable hanging out there.
Our meal portion was good! Our of all the dish, I enjoyed the Rapini (fresh filling and still light and refreshing to eat with accompanied bread!) and the grilled octopus (great to have octopus once in a while for me...and I loved that they gave us plenty of bread to sop the sauce!) The most. The pizza was good too..it wasn't too oily and I loved the smell and the mix of mushroom and meat on it. The salad was ok..quite ordinary..but nothing wrong with it. I think I will skip next time to try something else. We ate a lot but yet still had some salad and pizza leftovers for the next day.
Overall, a great, busy very reasonably priced restaurant in Beacon Hill to check out!
P.S: go early when they open at 5pm! We showed up at 4:4 5pm and the line was already forming. By the time we left, there were so many people waiting for the tables! They don't take reservations...and if you don't show up around opening time, you will likely have to wait in a potentially long line for your seat!","Kat V.","Have you ever complained that the food was too salty? Well you don't have to worry about that here! They don't even know what salt is here at BDC! I'd argue that they don't know what flavor is either, but that may be a bit harsh, plus I'm only 1 opinion.
We ordered the meatballs along with a margherita pizza and despite appearing delicious they were both MEH -- nothing special, almost bland! Very disappointing because I've never encountered such bland Italian food. I'll say though that the pizza crust was nice and thin and crisp, but the taste of charred crust was really all I tasted, and not because it was overpowering but because the sauce tasted like only a whisper of marinara.
There are much better Italian eateries around. Try Cascina Spinasse or Pizza Credo.","Bryan K.","Bar Del Corso is a quintessential neighborhood gem of a restaurant. I've heard so many good things about Bar Del Corso, now I'm kicking myself for not trying it sooner. I came with a friend on a Friday night around 6 and it was packed. Despite all the people waiting for a table, the wait only about 15 minutes.
The menu is quite small, but packed with goodness. We got the Suppli a Telefono (risotto balls), Polpettine (meatballs), and Funghi pizza. Risotto balls were the bomb. Rice and cheese rolled into a ball and fried golden brown. These are the kind of balls you want in your mouth... Meatballs were also very good served in a rich marinara sauce with slices of bread. Finally, the pizza is awesome. The crust is impossibly thin, yet still has structure, bite and the right amount of char. This is some of the best pizza in Seattle. The pizza comes uncut, with a pair of scissors so you can cut your own slices. You can cut once and say you only had 2 slices. The total came to a little over $30 for 2 which is an absolute steal. They don't have Happy Hour, but with these prices it's basically always Happy Hour.
The restaurant has the feel of an old local Italian joint with long bar area, open kitchen and large pizza oven roaring in the back. The staff was excellent and I can't say enough about the waitress that was running the double duty as the hostess. She really kept everything in check. If you can't tell, I'm in love with this place. I'm already plotting my next trip back.","Julianna P.","This place have awesome vibe but is very crowded. Expect to be bump into lot of times. There is really not much space to work with. Food is delicious. Servers are great and very helpful. Parking around the area is a nightmare when you decide to venture out for dinner. Also you will probably be waiting a lot to be seated. Prices are ok.","Ben C.","My hunt for my favorite pizza place in Seattle brought me here tonight. This is obviously a very popular establishment; even on a Wednesday night it was fully packed with a wait.
Living by the motto that any pizza is a personal pizza if you just believe in yourself, I ordered a margherita pizza. Really, if a neapolitan is done well, this is all you need.
The dough is paper thin yet doesn't get super crispy, aside from the proper scalding that the crust itself takes. The pizza is also well flavored, and very fairly priced for what you get. Overall I'm definitely a fan and will surely make it back here.","Allison D.","Have been coming here since it opened several years ago and they continue to be a neighborhood favorite for all the right reasons. Consistently great food, fun drinks menu, friendly service, great ambiance and a place to run into your neighbors. As the neighborhood changes and provides a larger restaurant mix we're more apt to find ourselves seated next to someone who has ""traveled"" from Madison Park or Belltown because BDC's reputation has spread, and deservedly so. The owners remain present and engaged, keeping the quality high. They've created a great menu, which is broad enough to offer something for most everyone, but small enough that attention to detail remains. Last night's squash blossoms were amazing, as was the cucumber, sun gold tomato and Burrata plate. So glad we managed to save room for the Affogato for dessert. Another lovely evening.","Lauren P.","Absolutely love this Neapolitan style pizza place. They cook them just right and make some good appetizers that I think must rotate. We have had meatballs that were perfectly seasoned with the best texture: not too dense, not too meaty. The atmosphere is very welcoming and we haven't had to wait for a spot, as there's typically space at the bar when all the tables are full. Definitely recommend if it you're open to pizzas other than Chicago/NY style.","Marie B.","Totally floored that it has been over three years since my third visit to Bar del Corso in Seattle's Beacon Hill neighborhood (7/14/17).
After another 10 hour workday, I drove in southbound traffic from Lynnwood (630pm Friday!) blasting my stereo with the occasional expletive....but darn it, I was on ravenous mission to have a real dinner. Lunch was via work vendor machine and long depleted.
Surprisingly, there was not crowd waiting for a table! I was able to be seated at 730pm on a Friday, come as you are, with no reservations...almost unheard of these days. Perusing the menu, one can practically feel the stress and fatigue melt away.
The outdoor seating, bar area, and indoor dining area were fairly full which kept the wait staff hopping and the conversation din dialed up. Lots of visual distractions from art work, food presentation, people watching which enhanced my dining experience.
Nice selection of beverages, especially with a full bar. Ordered a pint of local brew ($5.50), and for me copious refills of iced water.
Starter small plates, but generously sized, selected the Vongole alla Marinara ($10) with house bread and Burrata with heirloom and cherry tomatoes ($11). The latter was literally summer on a plate...creamy burrata on crostini, sweetest tomatoes, enhanced by the fresh basil, evoo, sea salt, and balsamic vinegar. Mmmmm!
Pizzas arrived well timed from their lovely Italian wood fired oven. Definitely experienced pizzaiolos! One also receives large shears to cut slices as big or small as you want. Last time I saw this was at the late Pizzeria Gabbiano.
Got filled up on starters, so boxed up the Romana ($13.50) with added mozzarella di bufala ($3.50) and the highly recommended Funghi ($14). This one had Crimini mushrooms, housemade sausage, cherry tomatoes with fontina and pecorino cheeses. Perfect composition!
Dessert were slices of Chocolate Hazelnut Gianduja cake served warm with whipped cream ($8 each). Just wished it had little to no powdered sugar.
Murphy's Law the gaming teenager, The Homie, texts me and now decides he's starving. So I placed an additional takeout order for Suppli al Telefono (aka aracini, $6) and Polpettine ($10)...the latter are 5 massive meatballs in sauce, not a Star Wars emperor. More slices of house bread were also kindly included. Kept piping hot enroute to Shoreline.
Also, bought a $25 gift certificate for my DPT who just moved from Mercer Island to Beacon Hill. Figured get him acquainted with a terrific, well established neighborhood spot!
Bar del Corso remains well worth the visit. Welcoming. Pleasant staff. Excellent cuisine. Just knocked off one collective Yelp star because of the wait during peak time, tried to turn our table over sooner as the later crowd was resurging. Also, the chairs aren't designed for lingering.
By all means, definitely do not wait over three years between visits! Praiseworthy, therapeutic dinner!","Roccella C.","First and foremost, we would like to establish that we love Bar Del Corso and will never stop eating here. It's delicious. The atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming. It's easily our favorite restaurant in Seattle. The service is hit or miss, but usually great. Five stars, because we are loyal customers and the only complaint we really have is:
1) The Burrata & Eggplant Caponata - it's so incredibly sweet you cannot taste the eggplant. Eggplant & burrata are STRONG ingredients that can usually stand alone as the sole focus of a dish. Unfortunately the only flavor we picked up on was balsamic.. :( please bring back the old burrata!
2) The baked cod in place of the cod fritters. Not great, and needed a bit more salt? And a touch too greasy... again, please bring back the old fritters! They're too good!
Outside of this, still one of the best spots in Seattle for Italian bites. Will continue to dine here and always encourage others to check it out!"
"Tribeca Kitchen & Bar","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tribeca-kitchen-and-bar-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Jeffrey K.","We had a fantastic dinner experience before going to the Paramount Theatre for a comedy show. Our server was a very nice young woman. She was very polite while answering a few questions we had about the menu. We ordered the garlic twists with cheese and another with no cheese. Both were very good. We also had the meatballs. Very good as well. The best I've ever had. I ordered the sausage pizza and it was great. Very tasty. Everyone else loved their food as well. Plates were damn near licked clean. The drinks were perfect. Every part of our experience was wonderful and we can't wait to go back.
On a side note. I did not like the automatic 20% tip on all tables, not just large groups. I like to decide how much to tip.","Jessica C.","Stopped in for a snack and drinks before a show. Ordered the clams and the bread basket. The clams were really good. Nice portion but expected for the price I guess. They did have a nice spice to it because of the chili oil. It also came with really well grilled bread. The bread basket was the same bread but without the nice grilling. I was so confused with some taste in the bread but I realized it was the olives that were in the bread. Wish it didn't have that. Partner thought the bread basket bread was too hard, particularly the crust. And it wasn't as nice as the grilled bread that came with the clams.
Also ordered a cherry blossom drink which was average. Didn't really taste like a cocktail but just the prosecco.","Heidi M.","Came in on a rainy cold evening and sat by the pizza oven, very warm.
Ordered mussels - was very disappointed:(. We had a glass of Prosecco and went somewhere else for dinner.
Good location, seemed like many guests are going to the Paramount or were out of towner folks staying in nearby hotels.
Dark atmosphere a plus. Clean bathrooms - that's always nice to have!","Gesina P.","I was super excited to try this place, but it was really disappointing. This review is based on food and price. Service was excellent.
We ordered the Arancini balls which were ok, margarita pizza with sausage (good), short rib parpadelle was ok at best. The meat was really tender but the parpadelle should have been run through a thinner setting on the pasta machine and for the love of food salt your pasta water! The seafood ravioli was by far the worst dish of the evening! The flavor was simply off and even though you expect a cream sauce to be rich and heavy simply everything on the dish was heavy. How did they make shrimp feel heavy?!??
In short save your $$$ and go to one of Seattle's 1000 restaurants","Peter C.","Tribeca has a nice happy hour that extends to 7pm, which is a little later than most bars or restaurants. From the happy hour menu, get the pizza, meatballs or bruschetta. All of those are delicious. During my second time at Tribeca, I decided to order off the dinner menu and get chicken picatta, which was also very good. That creamy, slightly lemony sauce is all you need to go with the pasta! A good choice if you are staying at one of the nearby hotels and don't want to walk far for dinner.","Sean B.","Decent food, but not especially memorable. Calamari starter was pretty standard. Wife thought the short rib ragu was a little too salty.
$25 for an average sized pasta dish also seems a bit pricey, but perhaps that's the norm for this part of Seattle.
Service was very good, and gotta give credit to our waiter, who recommended the perfect drink for my wife.
Overall, it is a nice spot but the food doesn't justify the price in my opinion.","L C.","We were in town for the Seahawks game and tried this place out and loved it! The seafood was fresh. I got the ravioli and it was delicious! We sat at the bar to watch college football and they were very attentive and even changed the channel so we could watch the college football game. Would recommend for a laid back chill atmosphere with good food!","Sukhman T.","We had made a reservation for 2 people and were greeted by the hosted to be seated as soon as we entered the place.
The place had a classic and modern interior. We ordered a pasta and bruschetta. The pasta had a strong taste of the olive oil and tomatoes. It had seasoning that mixed really well with the olive oil. The bruschetta's tomatoes were a little over done. I liked the pasta more than the bruschetta.
The food came in a timely manner and the waitress's checked on us just the right amount. I would come here again for the pasta.","Penelope B.","Yummy food! Nice staff! Owner is truly delightful. The restaurant is also so cute inside. Just go there... why not?","Kirsten H.","I came here for their happy hour and was disappointed to see they no served the fried cauliflower despite it being on their menu, but I did get to enjoy the brussel sprouts! HH is only at the bar, but the menu is longer than your usual hh menu and is worth looking at.","Crystin H.","Well what can I say ... the best clams I ever had in my life !!!! If I can eat them everyday I would haha, excellent service , romantic ambiance, great prices !","Wendy M.","I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH! We go every time we're in Seattle. The food is INCREDIBLE, so many options and everything is so delicious and prepped beautifully. The atmosphere is so inviting and it's very aesthetically pleasing. All of the staff are so welcoming and sweet, and service is fast and efficient! Highly recommend this place! Thank you for always satisfying us, Tribeca!","Emily J.","My friends just moved near by this place so it was easy to walk to for happy hour after work.
For food, we shared the mac & cheese with sausage. It was really good and if I go back, I will definitely be ordering it again. Not eating for awhile and a drink may have played into how good I thought it was though.
We had also ordered the meatballs but they never came. Turns out the waiter did not hear us even though he repeated what we ordered back to us out loud for us to confirm... oh well. Will just try them next time!
For the drinks, I ended up trying the Cherry Blossom and the Italia. Both were sweet and fruity. Not strong to the point that they were too strong for me to drink, but enough to know there was definitely alcohol in there.
The bar fills up pretty quickly after 5. If you are looking to get a table for happy hour, recommend getting there sooner than later. The night we went, lots of groups showed up hoping for tables and the place is not big at all. The counters at the bar were filled up and so were the tables. The staff made accommodations for one group to squeeze into the back but there weren't enough bar tables for everyone who was showing up.
The vibe in the place was happy and filled with people celebrating they were off work. Probably the night out type of feels you get on a Friday night even though it was a Thursday.","Lena W.","I was part of a group of 30 or so folk for lunch today. We had a limited menu developed based on the size of our group and it worked well. Our server, Jan (pronounced Yon), was incredible. There was another server assisting him but I didn't catch her name.
The food was incredible. Fresh made pasta and salads. I selected the rigatoni and meatballs and was so pleased. Everyone else was also pleased with their items ranching from the Tribeca Salad to the Stuffed Ravioli. The food was fresh, hot, and well-seasoned.
Service was great and so was the food. They don't have a large private room but I definitely recommend this spot for your group.","William G.","Once again, we've walked by this place SO many times, always looked intriguing, but stuck to the tried and true. Not this time! Oh my gosh, what an all-around great experience! This is not Elegant Dining, but definitely Fine Dining. We were a bit concerned when we entered due to the huge crowd at the bar and the noise level, but there was a holiday party going on, my guess is its normally quieter.
And again, so many great options to choose from on the menu!! All their pasta is made in-house from flour imported from Italy. We started off simply with the bread basket, no, it's not free, but it was great, nice crust on the outside, moist and chewy inside, the way we love it. The rosemary and olives incorporated in the bread made it perfect.
After much deliberation, I got the Frutto Di Mare, a seafood soup similar to Cioppino, paired with a glass of Dimajo Sangiovese. My wife got the Salmon Risotto and a Sauvignon Blanc. We were both thrilled with the meal! My meal was absolutely spectacular, wonderful layers of intense flavor, lots of seafood, great squid ink pasta. The salmon was cooked exactly to my wife's instructions, and was beautifully presented. AND, the wines were really good, and only $10 a glass! In Seattle!!
So, don't be like me, and just keep walking on by - walk in and give it a try!","Sin-Yaw W.","I have seen this place changed the name and operation the 3rd time by now. This time, as a lunch spot, it seems working. The beer selection was reasonable and food quite well done.
I will hop in next time for a dinner experience to render my final thought.","Christina S.","Very cute restaurant with a very comfortable leather seats across the street from the Hyatt Regency. We decided to go there because it was a little bit more casual for lunch and it had great reviews. We had the egg plant Parmesan sandwich, the chicken Parmesan sandwich, and a margarita pizza. All of them were delicious! The fries that they have our steak fries and those fries are crisp and delicious! Unfortunately, the service was not that great, it took about one hour to get our lemons for water. I am noticing that a lot of the restaurants here and Seattle charge a 20% service charge regardless. With that being said, the service definitely is not as good as it normally Would have been if it was not a mandated service charge.","Ben B.","We wanted a bite to eat before returning to the hotel and this place was surprisingly good.
Ordered the meat balls to share (enough for 2 if you're looking for something small to kick off) followed by a beetroot salad with a side of salmon and the beef fillet. Both were excellent and my steak came exactly how I asked. If you like your salmon a little more cooked rather than pink in the middle best to ask, I'm not a fan of really undercooked salmon unless it's sushi. Nice atmosphere and not noisy, clean and tidy to boot.
Service was prompt and friendly which suited us as we were both tired! It looked like this place could get busy, this was a Tuesday and fairly early evening (5:45 ish) so I would recommend booking ahead if there are more than 2 dining.
All in with a large bottle of sparkling water, with tip, came to $97. For great service and really good food it was well worth it. I didn't take a picture of the joint a it's nothing particularly special, typical downtown building with a restaurant in it.","Kevin I.","Admittedly, our first experience with Tribeca was less than stellar. That said, we are very happy we gave them another try.
Today we had good service, pleasant, efficient and quick, as we dined here for lunch. Just as before.
I had the Veggie Mushroom burger with Gruyere cheese and a side salad.
My other half had the BLT. She loves this sandwich here.
The burger was the perfect blend of fresh mushroom, grilled just right.
Gruyere cheese, melted to just the right temperature, relaxed but not dripping, and the bun was warm, soft and delicious.
Overall, we are pleased we gave them another chance and are looking forward to next meal here.","Rob O.","was a recommendation from our hotel that was somewhat connected to the Worldmark where we were staying. not bad, but not the best either.
squid ink calamari pasta was salty as heck.
kids cheese pizza was eh...
garlic bread was probably the best thing we had if it weren't for the bland tomato dipping sauce.
osso bucco was pretty expensive and also lacking in mind blowing flavor. i would have expected the osso bucco to be more tomato-ey if you get my drift. for a place like this in a prime area and for the price they charged, i would have expected more. will probably not visit if in the area again."
"Cuoco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuoco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joey P.","We had a team dinner at Cuoco last night and everything was great! There were 15 of us and they put us in a private room which was great. Our team of servers kept the food and drinks coming and everyone loved the food.
Highly recommend!","Abigail L.","What a lovely restaurant!
I enjoyed a meal alone here tonight for dinner and it was PERFECT. The place has a lively ambience with a homey feel to it. I don't know if it's the brick walls with the window view I had during the pouring rain and the street trees decorated covered with Christmas lights, but I felt so relaxed which helped me enjoy my meal even more. The glass of wine may have helped too lol.
I tried a glass of the 2017 Chianti red with the focaccia bread for appetizer, followed by a dish of the linguine clam pasta. The other other place I've really enjoyed a linguine clam pasta so far is at Carraba's in Houston, but I have now found my linguine place in Seattle.
I took my time since I was here alone and it was the most relaxing hour I've had all week!","Steve D.","Actually visited here twice this past week; must have had a hankerin' for Italian.
Summary - you sorta have to visit the place; the food is pretty good and the waitstaff are even better; was a super pleasant experience, unlike my prior experiment over at Anada...but I digress..
Good drink/wine selection (but I don't consider myself any good at wine selection; so darn confusing so I tend go by the recommendations and the length of wine list.
Varied selections for dinner, lots of options. Had the crispy octopus, and it was actually tasty (my first time); had the salmon and it was pretty good, had the meatball appetizer and it was awesome, and also had the lasagna bolognese and it was large enough to feed a trucker, but was really good, and I took it home. my buddy had the rigatoni , which had some spicy sausage and he ate it all up, looked great.
tried a dessert called the chocolate budino, and it had some very subtle flavors; maybe a sophisticated pudding.
btw, the happy hour menu looks interesting.","Maya D.","Stopped in for a quick bite after work. Delighted is the only word I need to describe my experience.
Had the burrata, Jaimie got a grin, broccoli, and meatball. Everything was heavenly.
Finished with tiramisu ( which I shared with a friend).
Definitely a place to place on the repeat list b","Ryen B.","Dinner with colleagues, so got to try a good sample of the menu.
- Negroni on tap was basic
- Baby lettuces are fresh and not too heavily dressed
- Beet salad comes with small cubes of roasted beets and a few slices of oranges
- Octopus is nicely cooked, though not a deal at $18
- Burrata was a pretty small serving for $16, but was creamy enough
- Smoked salmon risotto was well cooked. The serving is large and heavy, as risotto tends to be, so a good dish to share
- Rapini- this side was perhaps my fave dish of the night. Nice and garlicky
- Coconut cream pie- exactly what you'd expect. The big slice is plenty to share.
Dishes are safe with options you can find on menus everywhere these days, so good place to go if you don't have adventurous eaters. Nothing blew me away, but no complaints either. Server was friendly. Drinks were fine. Not a place I'd go back to with so many other options in this city, but fine for what it is.","Darin A.","With a rare chance to hang out with coworkers, we chose Cuoco and had a wonderful evening here.
The wild boar ragu with foraged mushrooms was incredible and my only regret was not having more...until it came time for dessert. I can't go to an Italian restaurant and not try the Tiramisu as it gives me a great picture of the quality as well as (hopefully) leaving me with a sweet taste in my mouth about the place as I leave. Cuoco nailed it. It may have broke into my top 5 favorite Tiramisu dishes ever which is really saying something as I come from an Italian town! I walked away from an incredible night with friends having enjoyed good wine, food, dessert, and service. Everything was in place and nothing took away from our time together, which is always the most important part.
Highly Recommend.","S H.","Couldn't go wrong with pesto pasta! The dish was great but a little on the bland side, would have loved a pinch more salt. Ordered the ginger beer which was super strong but delicious. The interior is very rustic-chic with plenty of seating!
***Dined here during the Amazon bring your parent to work day, so the menu was different than usual***","Saurabh C.","We were craving Italian for lunch today while visiting friends in Capitol Hill and decided to try this place which has good review on yelp.
Parking was a bit tough even during regular work hours but surprisingly it was not very busy when we made it there with our reservation.
The place had a very rustic and quiet environment with plenty of seating. We were greeted warmly and the service was great.
We ordered the homemade garlic bread and meatballs appetizers. I really enjoyed the meatballs with the tomato sauce it came in with a rich deep flavor. The garlic bread was slightly over cooked but not spectacular and was okay!
For entree we ordered the rigatoni and lasagna. Both of the dishes were delicious and amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed my rigatoni with a flavorful pork sausage chunks in it with a creamy ragu sauce with sweet and spicy flavor.
The portion sizes here are not huge but the right amount with the quality you expect from a Tom Douglas joint. I ordered an affogato as a desert which had a good vanilla bean ice cream scoop and a bit bitter espresso for my taste but I was palatable.
I would give this place a 4 star for the quality of food and service we received. My only knock at this place was the menu choices. It was very limited! I'm not the one who likes a book as a menu but I wish they had more variety of appetizers & pastas. I couldn't pick more than 1-2 items I would want to try there again due to the choices. The drink menu had more choices that food.
The quality of pasta is fresh and you can see its homemade. I wish they would add more pasta choices specifically the carbonara to make me come back. For now if I am craving a rigatoni or lasagna I would definitely try this place again.","Jacques I.","Not the best. My friend and I came here for lunch during Seattle Restaurant Week and can't say I'd return anytime soon.
Let me just first say the service here was absolutely perfect. We came in during our lunch hour; and notified our server that we were on a time crunch, so that she could expedite service, which she certainly did. She checked in with us throughout our lunch, which led her to offer us a redo of the entree we ordered.
For the two-course $15 Seattle Restaurant Week special, I started with the Lentil Soup and had the Rigatoni for my entree, the same as my friend's entree. Soup was fine, but the Rigatoni was sadly, disappointing. It mostly was from how under-cooked the pasta was, making it too firm in texture. I was hesitant to say anything at first since we were on a time crunch and needed to get back to the office soon, but our server was so concerned with our disappointment that she reassured the kitchen could redo the rigatoni for us to go, in time for when we needed to leave. It was generous of her to offer and she seemed genuinely concerned. If it had not been for her wonderful customer service, I'd cross off Cuoco off my list for good. Plus, once I had the remade rigatoni the following day, the texture of the pasta was al dente/much better.
All in all, Cuoco isn't my favorite Tom Douglas restaurant. And with other affordable pasta eateries coming to town, it just doesn't compare. I'd come back for happy hour and try some bites, but it wouldn't be my first choice.","Michelle S.","The food, especially the fresh pasta, is wonderful, and the restaurant is very nice. My main complaint was the service. Our server was clearly uninterested in us once it was obvious we were not going to order drinks (despite the fact that both of us ordered an appetizer and entree, and shared a dessert). The server did not offer us the specials (I could hear them being offered at other tables), took away the bread plates before we were finished, and left me feeling unwelcome. Once the restaurant became busier, we were ignored, and I had to go to the hostess desk to finally ask for the check. Overall, I was left with the impression that since gratuity is included, and my dinner guest and I were not going to buy alcohol and therefore be the highest spenders, that we were unimportant. What a shame.","Golda V.","Four stars go to the drinks. May be it was just what I got but I wasn't all that impressed by the food given all the other great options around the area. I love pasta, but the smoked salmon ravioli dish just didn't do it for me. Something was lacking in the flavor, surprising given how flavorful smoked salmon can be all on its own. However, I have yet to be disappointed by the drinks here, be it the cocktails or the wine I've had. The place itself is pretty nice. Beware though, it can get quite busy and loud here during the lunch rush. In comparison, 3pm here is almost a ghost town, great if you want to get work done. Moscow mules here are pretty good from what I remember. Come here for the drinks, not the food.","Connie A.","My colleague and I decided to make reservations to try out their Seattle Restaurant Week Lunch promotion, and were in anticipation to try out their menu items. When we arrived, we waited a short moment before we were seated. We told the server that we were on a time crunch and she was great in taking our orders swiftly. For appetizers, my friend ordered the baby lentil soup while i opted for the baby lettuce. We both ordered rigatoni with spicy sausage ragu for the entree item.
It didn't take long for our food to arrive. I guess our server placed a note to the kitchen of our time rush and so our food came out relatively quick. But because of this, the quality of our food seemed to have been compromised. First, I was a bit confused by the salad - there were large chunks of celery and I personally just didn't think the vinaigrette dressing paired well with the ingredients. The rigatoni was a bit of a let down. It was undercooked and luke-warm when served. When I bit into the pasta, you can clearly tell that it was not cooked through. Though unimpressed, we continued on with the rigatoni-- until our server stopped by to check on us. When we revealed this to her, she immediately apologized and expressed that this is not the quality they strive for and offered to remake our entrees for us to go. We agreed, and she came back less than 15 minutes later with two to-go boxes, all nicely packed up for us. I really appreciated her ability to reconcile the issue.
Truthfully, the pasta still did not live up to my expectation, especially considering this is a Tom Douglas restaurant. There are plenty of places that make more exceptional pastas at a much lower price. Our server went above and beyond and certainly deserved a 5/5. Food wise, I'm going to have to give 3/5.","Ahmed B.","I had only two things on the menu and they were great, so I am a fan. The ambiance and service also was nice so I am adding a star for that.
The gnocchi was nice and the coconut pie dor dessert was amazing.
This is SLU so tons of Amazon folks and due to location a bit pricey.","Katya S.","This is a perfect example of how reputation of a restaurant can be tarnished by unreasonable reviews. I've lived in the neighborhood for several years, and have experienced dining all across Seattle. I consider myself a foodie and will, without a doubt say that Cuoco has always delivered consistently good food. This is one of the best restaurants in SLU. So ignore the reviews, relax, and order a negroni and a lasagna next time you're in the area.
P.S. The lasagna is even better on the second day.","Amanda V.","Went for lunch with our work team. The pasta was fresh and delicious. I tried the spicy rigatoni, a fan favorite. Portions were a bit small. The sauce was a bit spicier than I'd normally go, but that's not saying much. So delicious, great service.","David B.","A fun and excellent happy hour. The food is well presented. Despite being a Tom Douglas joint it is still good. What he has done to Alaska Airlines should be consider a high crime.
The staff was attentive and the choices good. Like the old days at Palace Kitchen, the cocktails were marvelous and very nicely executed.
A fun little secret in the midst of the hive mind of Amazon.","Sloan C.","Seems like this is the only Italian restaurant in the neighborhood and I do think it's quite disappointing. Friend and I went together and we went with the recommendation to order squid ink pasta and rigatoni with pork ragu. Both were pretty bland... although service was great.","Cindy S.","My team stopped in for lunch and it was terrific.
The hostess and waitress were friendly and helpful with the menu selections.
We ordered the warm bread which was very aromatic and delicious!
I ordered lasagne and you could taste the homemade pasta and it was quite flavorful.","Frankie K.","Of all the Tom Douglas restaurants, this is one I never hear much about and always overlook despite living just a few blocks down the street. It was never high up on my priority list of places to try, but I'm glad I did. That being said, I do agree with the other reviews, Cuoco didn't 'wow' me. It is good, not great.
Hearing people rave about the meatballs, I came in with high expectations. Were they good? Absolutely, but I still can't wrap my mind around what everyone is blown away about... HOWEVER their Capalletti is another story. Our server described it the best way I could imagine ""each bite is like an explosion of cheese in your mouth"". If there is one thing to know about me, that exact phrase is what my dreams are made of, and what my heaven would consist of. So, yes, I have to say their Capalletti is what brings me back. Another fan favorite of ours was their Aged Rib Eye.
All in all, I have nothing bad to say other than maybe I just built the meatballs up in my head too much before going into it, and set myself up for disappointment. :/","Cory C.","The food was okay, not great and not bad either. The service is where they suffer, and part of the reason is that the servers get an automatic tip so why even try. Our server never asked how our meal was nor did she refill our drinks or our waters. The place is nice but when your servers do not care, why should I."
"Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/buca-di-beppo-italian-restaurant-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Bob G.","I came in today to troubleshoot a phone and computer. By the time I was done, I was starving! I hadn't been to this location since our kids were teenagers and I didn't realize that they started serving lunch about a year ago. After I was finished with my work I sat in the bar and looked over their lunch menu. I really had a hard time trying to decide but it came down to the lasagna or the meatball sandwich. The bartender told me the lasagna was her favorite of the two so I went with it. It was much better than I expected and was comparable to my homemade lasagna. Even though the lunch portions are ""lunch"" size it was almost more than I could eat. I was glad I didn't go with a salad or garlic bread because I would have definitely over indulged. The only let down was I was so hungry that I forget to take a picture to post here. If you're in their neighborhood stop in for lunch.
I can't say much about their family style dinners since it's been so long. It was always a fun atmosphere with a small group and a great place to feed teenagers. It sounds like that part hadn't changed.","Brandon V.","Buca di Beppo might be the most flamboyantly fun restaurant in Seattle!
Went there for my birthday recently and had an absolutely fabulous time. The food was delicious but you have to know what to order. The meatballs, meatballs, meatballs galore! Do yourself a favor and order the Brussels sprouts, garlic cheese bread and a pizza too! Also don't forget a few 22oz beers ;)
The servers are friendly, the atmosphere is ridiculous and festive and the laughter fills the dining room and goes through the roof. The place is clean and well maintained, decorations everywhere.
Highly recommended :)","Alice X.","This place is OK, just OK for me because I'm not a die hard fan of pasta. It's perfect for a large group of hungry people. Portions are huge! You'll have food for days!
The decor of the restaurant is basically your classic Italian restaurant.
The place is also kids friendly. Kids get crayons to draw.
The servers are also really nice and efficient.","Yuchen Z.","Oh Bucca....how I love thy for your large portions and delicious pastas.
Atmosphere: very old school traditional/stereotypical Italian restaurant with the red & white table cloths and Christmas decor all around. Large pasta sauces every where and pictures of people that have eaten there on the walls.
Food:
Huge portions - they only feed 3 (small) or 5 (large) and there's still plenty for leftovers. I come here with my partner and we get the small, and between the two of us, we can get in a total of 6 meals (so once sit down and 2 times eating the leftovers). But that applied mainly to their Sunday Family Dinners which I think is the best deal. You get garlic bread, salad, sausage, meatballs, and a giant bowl of ziti. We've come here many times for this special and it feeds up halfway through the week. Highly recommend!
+ We've come here for their other pastas as well and I have not been disappointed with their flavors. If you come here just for the pastas, I'd recommend coming with a group because if you order just one dish, there's a lack of variety. That's why some people complain about the prices. It really should be family style.
Overall, I highly recommend Bucca for their Sunday Family Dinners and Half Off Meatball Mondays. Otherwise, if you come here with a large group, it's good to order just a few dishes to share to offset the prices.","Rebecca F.","First time back in 7 years!
Nice waiter, mediocre large portions of food, and found a hard piece of plastic in a dinner roll. Might be another 7 years until we return.","Alexis M.","The portions are huge. They feed way more than the suggested serving on the menu. The food is pretty average tho, but their caesar salad is amazing. Also don't come here if you are vegan, all of their pasta includes eggs.","Marlowe C.","Enjoyed the hospitality, the supremo pizza was delicious parking across the street. Cozy and comfortable seating looking forward to coming back.","A H.","I ordered food for my staff of 4 people. This location is 0.6 miles away, which is an 11 minute walk. It took the delivery driver 85 minutes to arrive at our location. The food is cold and soggy. No apology or reimbursement was given. We will never patronize from this establishment again.","Nichole B.","Very good italian food! Huge portions and great service. I recommend the baked ziti, chicken carbonara and the chopped antipasto salad.","Tony J.","Family style Italian restaurant on Westlake Ave in SLU. Went there for lunch with a party of a dozen people on a weekday, and we were one of the first parties to arrive. Mid-size interior with interesting decor. Services was pretty good.
Their menu has individual-portion options, but they also have a lot family-style options that's meant to serve a couple of people. We ended up ordering two salads, three pastas, and two tiramisu cakes for dessert. The salad, pasta and garlic bread servings were huge. We probably finished less than half of the food. I like the garlic bread and the tiramasu. The pasta and the salads were alright. Lots of quantity, but average quality. Two of the pastas looked and tasted kind of the same even though one was supposed to be spicy. Overall, a decent option to feed Italian food to large parties.","Christy K.","I was a fan of buca but you need to control your delivery drivers. Please hire safe drivers that won't curse and scream out of their cars while making illegal turns in a buca vehicle. It was absolutely insane.
This is regarding an incident around noon on 5/30/19.
I was in a right turn lane on Howell and Boren turning, when the buca car pulled up next to me (from behind) in the middle no turn lane. Oncoming traffic made it impossible to make the turn for a bit, but seems like she got impatient.
She pulled up and started screaming obscenities, pulled up in the middle of the intersection, illegally blocking, then made an illegal turn while continuing to screech at me.
So angry Seattle driving, just in a buca car and on meth.
Not a great look.
Please sit down and have a conversation with your staff about driving like normal people.
I road rage too--everyone does from time to time. But your drivers endangered people around them, and that driver at noon today should not be driving for you, let alone on the road to begin with.
In terms of food, I did like the pasta month a couple months back. The pappardele was great. But it's not worth supporting a business that endangers peoples lives.","Mike L.","Very italian decor, nice staff. Portion is huge, for family-style sharing. Parking is a bit difficult, need to go around to find it. And it doesn't help that there is lots of traffic during rush hours.
The food selection is good, salmon is good. If your birthday is nearby, then you get one big scoop of ice cream for free!","Cristina G.","This restaurant was critically understaffed and the excuse ""that they were transitioning (that day), from an old district manager to a new one, wasn't a good enough excuse for wasting an hour waiting for bad food.
I can't believe how much money they spent on the remodel, expansion and dealing with the increased rents in the area, given their horrible food and understaffing. While I am sympathetic with how hard it is to hire staff in downtown Seattle, this restaurant as it is now, is killing their brand equity and goodwill.","Obsa A.","The worst customer service walked in there at 5:05 got my food at 6 o'clock Kept axing the server how long is the food going to take and she kept saying I don't know I don't cook the food she wouldn't even give me an estimate so after an hour looks like a manager brought our food and I ask him does it usually take one hour to serve food he goes no this tickets only been up for 25 minutes so now he is saying I'm making it so I asked him to bring the ticket and he told me thats not happening again I'll never go back there The worst experience I have ever had never again","Igor I.","I've made an online order to this restaurant in Seattle using their own website. My food was never delivered and my credit card was charged. I've already call them 3 times, being personally in the place claiming my refund and I just hear ""we cannot do refunds locally, must be done by corporate"". And guess what, corporate never called me, I never got my refund. Run from this place, they take your money but don't deliver you food. Just ridiculous!
Update due to comment from Bucca di Beppo Customer Service:
Bucca di Beppo Customer Service, please don't lie in Yelp saying that you are concerned. I've already send a message using your website, already called Seattle restaurant manager 3 times, already gone personally in the restaurant once. And I just don't get my refund. Really, you guys have my contact, as I said I've already contacted you many times.","Brad J.","This is a chain restaurant, very low quality food at an exorbitant price. It's not fun. It is cheap and sad, like going to a matinee in the mall. The food really sucks . Did I mention it is sad. It's just corporate garbage food. Just go to Olive Garden and save yourself some money. There is no charm or character to this soulless establishment, it makes me want to start planning my funeral.","Miguel C.","Food of course was delicious, waitress wasn't in the pleasant of moods , everything else virtually *****","Lee C.","Brought the wife here opening time on a Monday. No reservation required. We always get the usual. Caprese Salad, Eggplant Parm, and Chicken Parm. The food was excellent as usual. This location recently moved. Much bigger space with views of the lake and city. The only thing missing is the Chefs table which the fire department declared illegal which is a shame. I've always wanted to sit there but oh well. I think the prices may have increased as well. If you want to have a great time, good food and atmosphere, I highly recommend. However....I had to make it a 4 star due to the price. Will definitely come again next time we are in the city.","Hanako M.","For a family of 6, I always know that Buca can seat my entire family and understand how to serve a large group. Reservations can be made online. They also have an awesome takeout/ catering menu. I usually order a plate of calamari, garlic bread, 1 small entree and 2 large entrees and with 4 teenagers, I still have leftovers to take home!","Nicole S.","I don't normally write reviews, but I feel compelled to speak to the immaculate customer service and servitude I experienced during my dining experience. Fluffy (aka Greg) at the South Lake Union location made our experience. He was polite, thoughtful, humorous and forthright. I am very grateful for the wonderful service."
"La Medusa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-medusa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tenzin D.","Had a reservation here the other night with my boyfriend. Came in and waited 30 minutes, which was expected since they were a full house and every seat was packed. I loved the liveliness and atmosphere of the restaurant. Beautiful theme and lighting!
Friendly waitress who accommodated us
throughout the night and had wonderful conversations that seemed genuine!
We started off with bakery bread which tasted delicious and light but not as fresh as I'd wish it would've been but should've been expected. Would've been nice touch to have some warmed bread. We also ordered the arancino which was really delicious especially the mozzarella in the middle of it. Wonderful touch!
For entrees, we ordered spaghetti with meatball and the popular Squid Ink spaghetti. Both entrees were spectacular and left me full. I personally enjoyed the meatballs on the spaghetti, definitely a unique taste to a classic staple. Squid Ink was delicious has well but nothing too out of the ordinary, just the idea that it was black noodles. The flavor profile is wonderful however.
Will come back again!","Kendra W.","Come for the cocktails, the wine and the incredible deserts! These can't be missed in this cute, rustic, local eatery in the heart of Columbia City. The rest, well, good luck!
First- get an early reservations. If you get a reservation after 7pm you will likely have to wait 15-30 minutes for the prior table to finish their meal as guests tend to linger and the service is on island time.
The salads are good, the veggies they use are very fresh. The entree's were forgettable, if not offensive. I had the pork entree and it was reminiscent of a Hungry Man Chicken Fried Steak, at $34, you can see how I might be a tad underwhelmed and even offended. My dinner date stated his meat dish tasted like a fancy Hamburger Helper. Another diner in our group had the squid pasta, which must be for an acquired taste as no one in our group was a fan.
I would come back for the wine, the cocktails and the can't be missed deserts as long as I had a reservation that began before 6pm to be sure I could be seated in a timely manner. For dinner, I guess it's an acquired taste, but we weren't digging it.","Claudia C.","We have been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally got our chance last week. We had a late dinner reservation but decided to stop in earlier for a drink and small bite before catching the movie across the street: I don't give reviews much, but i just had to after such a special, wonderful experience. The staff was so friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The menu was not huge, but had varied choices. We all ordered something different so that we could sample various dishes. They were all so fantastic and tasty! Another plus is that this restaurant has a cute and cozy ambiance. We all agreed that we will definitely be paying another visit soon and encourage you to do so as well!","Colin P.","Great neighborhood spot. Kind of anchors the higher end dining scene in Columbia City and is consistently a great meal with super friendly service, regardless of what you order. The tagliatelle, the rigatoni, the arancini.. it's all good.","Matteo B.","Awesome sicilian food. It is a super small space so you really need to get reservation or you won't find a spot.
The space is really cozy and the food is excellent along with the service.","Carolyn J.","La Medusa came with it! Dinner was amazing for us! The food , ambiance and service was top notch.
La Medusa is a quaint staple in the neighborhood. Weekends are hard to get a table but worth getting on the list or make a reservation.
The food is simply delicious. We had the aracini and beets to start, so good. We ate them too fast. The bread , I assume is from Columbia City next door, you get a variety of their delicious breads.
We had two pastas, the spaghetti and meatballs , wow! Simple fresh marinara sauce and unforgettable large meatballs. The meatballs is tops , tender and full of flavor and not salty, I asked the server what the recipe is for the meatballs and of course she smiled and wouldn't tell me.
We had the squid ink spaghetti vongole , so good again subtle flavors , perfect clams.
We had our third course of the veal shank and polenta. We did not leave anything , plate empty! We like to compare how veal shank is prepared when we travel so La Medusa is succulent and tender and not salty like some I have had.
The dessert course is never to be missed at La Medusa , Pana Cotta is exceptional, we had the chamomile and honey water one, omg we wanted another. We also had the pistachio cannoli , you have to ask why aren't they bigger?!
The bottle of Italian Valpolicella was perfect with everything we ate, so order a bottle and relax and eat some good food!","Mario E.","My coworker suggested La Medusa as an option for a date night since my girlfriend loves pasta. It's been awhile since I've eaten here and I was not disappointed with my decision. Immediately when we entered the restaurant, we were met with a warm greeting like we were at a friend's home. Jackson, our server, was amazing!! He suggested the best wines to pair with our dishes. The food was superb. The rigatoni was full of flavor. The squid ink pasta was delicious with a generous amount of clams. The chocolate espresso torte was divine! Jackson was even kind enough to snap a photo of us on date night. We are definitely coming back! Oh and I forgot to mention that we love Chef Zoi Antonitsas!!!","david c.","This place was charming and the food was good not great.
We had reservations sat down at 730, waiter did not a knowledge us for 30 mins? He was just standing around doing everything but come over , restaurant was not full at all? The bus boy was filling our water to kill the time, I ask him to inform the waiter we were ready for service, another 10 minutes go by, with zero apologies took our wine order another 20 minutes goes by! All this time I can see him just standing there? Decides to bring us wine glasses but no wine! Another 10 goes by he brings the wine. Took our order, food came out slowly, never checked back, except for the bus boy! We had to ask him again to ask that waiter to come over! Ordered another bottle, 20 minutes later he shows up with wine? My friend complained to deaf ears they claimed there was no manager? Over all the worst service! Never going back. Tip him 0! I tipped the bus boy!!!","Madison M.","We have lived in Columbia city for 1 year and have never been here. My fiancé and I finally decided to come here and we were very underwhelmed. We looked at the menu and were exited to taste the pasta and primi items. We got the anchovies with raspberries and tiny flowers, the anchovies were good but a bit acidic. Then we had the Arancini but it was a big chungus so it wasn't cooked properly. We had the rigatoni with broccoli which was flavorless and under salted. The spaghetti Nero was the best dish of the night. It was a bit over salted but the clams made up for that. Boo ya Madison OUT","Prajna T.","The food at this place is excellent, and anyone who is not particular about waiting way too long for dinner should defiantly check it out. We had a risotto and vegetable appetizers - steak, pasta and tuna entrees for dinner. While the steak was under cooked, the flavors and quality were all great. Panna cotta and chocolate cake for desert were divine.
My only complaint is with how long the food took to come out (at least 45 mins from ordering). I actually thought the kitchen staff might have walked out, and there was not good communication or really any sort of acknowledgment of the delay by the staff.
I had been to this place a few years ago, and will defiantly check it out again, but won't rush back as I can't take the risk of waiting like this again.
Barring service issues, this could definitely be a 4/5 star place.","Laura D.","Amazing food and service! Upscale rustic might be a good way to describe their menu. Quality ingredients put together in a slightly unexpected way that satisfies. And I am not a big dessert person, but if they have ricotta cake, GET IT! And the carrot and cheese appetizer, random when you read it, SO GOOD! Definitely make reservations.","Joanna C.","I agree with all the great ratings that are shared. All in all they describe the La Medusa well. However, this Tuesday we found the noise level so high that conversation was difficult among 4 people. In the past this was not an issue that we noticed, and we will likely give it on more chance. Since dinner conversation is important part of the ambiance for us, if it persists, we will likely not return.","Mariana D.","Good staff and great food.
I went there for a dinner and I had a good time!
Me and my family love this place. It's good for big groups and small ones as well.","Palmer B.","Favorite restaurant in Seattle! Always a warm experience with great food. We try and make it a point to come back at least every other month. Highly recommend!","Khamn B.","Delicious. Some dishes are artistic in their simplicity and stellar quality. Go to spot when my Wife and I crave A1 pasta. Service is always exceptional. 10 stars.","Robert B.","Very good, well-established Italian restaurant in the hip and getting hipper Columbia City neighborhood...
THE ROSES: Food is quite good, with what appears to be a rapidly-rotating menu (no printed menus; current offerings are in a blackboard on the wall. Dishes are well executed, and service is quite good. Fun location with good view of the local scene. Upscale but friendly and unpretentious clientele makes for great people-watching.
THE THORNS: Even on a weeknight, parking is quite difficult in this neighborhood. Not as bad as Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, or Fremont, but no picnic. While having no printed menu and just relying on a chalkboard saves money, it's kind of a pain for those seated at far tables or with their backs to the board. Some dishes (fish soup) could be a little more aggressively seasoned. A little on the spendy side for what you're getting, especially the wines (nothing under $10/glass - they really need to offer a simple 'vin ordinaire' to compliment the rustic ambiance and menu).
THE VERDICT: This neighborhood institution's culinary offerings make it a real Seattle 'destination restaurant' as well. While a little spendy, it is a definite standout in Seattle's crowded Italian restaurant market. Recommend.","Jamie N.","I want to start off by saying my girlfriend and I have both been in the service industry for almost 10 years, so we have seen some sh*t. We are not the typical snobs to write negative reviews on a place just because the food was under salted. That being said, this was hands down the worst restaurant experience we've ever had. We made an anniversary reservation a week in advance, stoked to try this friken pasta. We arrived at 7:30, and our table was not ready. We waited an additional 15 minutes to be seated at a table (that wasn't so great to be honest) and ordered drinks. Drinks took about 20 minutes to come out. By then we were a little annoyed but still, we are pretty easy to please and understanding (industry gals), and they were busy for a Tuesday night.
All right y'all this is where it gets fun. Our server takes our FULL ORDER, complimenting us on what we've chosen. Tables around us get sat, we ask for a wine list.. Tables around us get food... We're still waiting on our wine list.
Finally, we get a list.. select a bottle. 15 mins go by we get our bottle... we're drinking a whiiiiiiiiile..
and then,
OUR SERVER ASKS IF WE ARE READY TO ORDER DINNER. I'm sorry, what? We've already been waiting over an hour for our apps. Said server asks us to repeat what we initially ordered. Chef comes out and apologizes.. it never got put in. They didn't put in the dang order. What the H-E DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS!! At this point, we're about to break up with each other after six long years cause we're hangry. Our relationship has lasted so many ups and downs but not this got dang service y'all. So we leave, our drinks comped (duh) and will probably never come back. Go to McDonald's, you'll honestly get better service.
I wish I could rate the food but we never got it so damn. Oh well....","A N.","Went with friends who know the chef. Started with great coffee, then on to appetizers.... we ordered them all. Then we ordered all the entrees and shared them. Everything was perfect. Pasta was perfect, everything was fresh, wines were killer, staff was great! And I LOVE how their menu changes with availability of fresh ingredients.... I will definitely return!!","Linh N.","This cute little place has stolen my heart and my stomach.
Came here for dinner on Friday with one of my best friends and here I was telling her I didn't want to eat and I ended up eating everything she ordered. The restaurant was fully booked when I arrived but my friend somehow manage to get us these cute little window seating off to the side. It was weird at first but I ended up loving our seating because we pretty much sat in the corner people watching out these gigantic windows.
We started off with some bread and olive oil then ordered the burrata with a caprese salad, saffron risotto croquette, and we finished with the squid ink spaghetti. Everything was delicious! I was thinking I'd have just a nibble ended up eating everything haha.
The burrata that we ordered with the caprese salad was really light and when you had it with the tomatoes, ugh so much yes! I honestly hate tomatoes but I have never said no to a good caprese salad haha. The risotto that my friend ordered was also fricken delicious. I remember is have that somewhere else and it didn't taste as good as the one at Le medusa. The way they served it was super cute also. I don't know what I was expecting from the squid ink spaghetti. I kept thinking it was going to be served with tomato based sauce and was surprise when it came out without it. I thoroughly enjoyed that dish, a tad bit salty but if I wasn't so full better believe I would have finished it.
We never have left overs when I dine out with my friend so imagine our surprised when we were trying to get the other person to take the last bit of spaghetti home. Either way, I'm really glad we decided to have dinner here. I most definitely want to come back and try other yummy dishes.","Barbara R.","Last night I had a terrifying choking episode at this wonderful little restaurant. The immediate attention by sou chef Walker and host Jackson saved my life. The care received from this staff was absolutely incredible. Walker, Jackson, server Julie and fellow diners continued to check on me. Chef made a special broth for me and Walker gave me a panna cotta and pasta dish to take home. A fellow diner was a doctor who spent a long time with me dispensing valuable advice about what to do going forward. I was overwhelmed with gratitude around the care I got last night from the staff and fellow diners. Sadly I could not eat the short ribs I had ordered but my fellow diner was in heaven with hers!"
"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Mia Z.","We had an exceptional experience here last night. We came here to celebrate a special event cuz it is one of my bf's fav restaurants in seattle for pastas. And oh man. They definitely are specialized in pastas. All pastas are made fresh daily in the house and we ordered 3 appetizers and 4 pastas!
Rainbow carrots, fennel crab salad and tomato salad. Every single one of them is so tasty and we absolutely loved every bit of it.
Pesto pasta was probably my fav for the night! Squid ink pasta was good too.
A bottle of rose on the house for our special occasion celebration and bill was not breaking our wallet even with this much food!
Will be back and definitely recommend it if you want great pasta for the night!","Marie B.","This was a return visit to Le Messe this evening to celebrate a college friend's belated birthday. She wanted Italian and selected Le Messe back on 10/7/18.
Fast forward to 11/20/19...a well aged 13 month incomplete post. Dined at Le Messe at least three times total.
Love Vendemmia in Madrona, will have to make an effort to score a reservation to Raccolto in West Seattle though. But then, enjoyed Il Nido over in Alki Point/West Seattle by Chef Easton of Il Corvo fame.
Just tried G.H. Pasta in Denny Regrade/Belltown earlier this afternoon, which was a 3 star review too.
Posting this to at least get 20 photos stuck in Yelp purgatory out in the open. Still have that infamous Yelp review backlog from Oct 2018.
Le Messe still going strong and holding its own along with well established Serafina and Pomodoro, also found along Eastlake. So many Italian spots in Seattle featuring handmade pasta!","Maryline W.","Despicable experience. Made reservations ahead. Arrived and were welcomed as if it was a surprise borderline inconvenient. The first draw back is the noise. It was so loud we couldn't have a basic face to face conversation. We proceeded to order wine from our charismatic friendly waiter. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. It took 90 minutes! 90 minutes to get a cold fennel crab flake salad. Still wonder if the crab was just a garnish on the menu to appease novice critics. The second appetizer never came and by the time we got our pasta dish we had been seated for 2 hours.
We could have left, mind you. Complained even. BUT this was Saturday night. The only break we get from our 50h+ shifts/week. We just wanted to remain positive and make the best of our special evening. The manager we suspect generated a form of apology when he delivered the bill because they overcharged us for food we never received and the ""wonky"" Saturday they were having. So now not only did I lose 2 hours of my life I can not get back, but I also need to feel bad for an overpriced botched dinner experience too!? How absurd!
Lesson learned: next time. We will order $100 worth of fresh organic local food, have it delivered, fix our own gourmet dinner and swear off dining out for that Seattle's dining has become a complete scam where profit drives the least scrupulous ones and where pride in your work is an art/virtue of the past.","Tara D.","Three words. Squid. Ink. Pasta. Thats what I got and honestly was the pull for me to try this place originally, but all their pastas are fantastic.
The ambience is amazing and the decor was sleek and sophisticated.","Rachel E.","The beef tartare and burrata weeabsolutely delicious! The bread served with both was the perfect compliment. The rigatoni and tagliatelle were delicious and perfect al dente. All staff were pleasant and efficient. Will definitely come again. Reservations recommended for busy weekends.","Kamara S.","We all have restaurants that we keep coming back to, even if they are a distance away. Le Messe is that place for me.
My first visit was due to a need for pasta and my experience there did not disappoint. So even though I live in the Eastside, I find ways to come back.
My favorite experience is at the chef's counter where they have special items you can't get anywhere else at the restaurant. That where I went my first time and I fell in love. Probably is the place I had bucatini for the first time.
This trip I did the tasting and I believe I am a better person because of it. This is coming from a person who is not picky but is not the biggest fan of someone else choosing their food options. But at least they were kind enough to ask about my allergies and preferences.
The highlights (there weren't any lowlights but these stood out to me:
The zucchini salad and the bread dish was so good, I forgot to take pictures of them .
The steak as the meat course was fantastic. The
The cooked salmon was by far one of the best dishes I ever had. Not only because I could cut the fish with my fork, but because of that skin. It was the right level of crispy goodness that I was heartbroken when I finished it.
And the pasta was fantastic of course. And it was made better by the great service.
Caveat: You can not rely on the website to see what the current offerings are. Which means the items are made fresh, but don't have your heart set on the something you saw on their site as there are not up to date.
But with the food I had, I wasn't definitely wasn't disappointed. Though I wish they were on the Eastside","Marina G.","Today was my second time here and it completely affirmed my belief that Le Messe is the best restaurant in Seattle. Everything is perfect. The dishes have immense depth and flavor while also being simple and intuitive. Many kudos to the chef. The wine selection is great, the deserts are great. And the service is amazing! Great energy, our server understood when we needed something and when we didn't. I can't remember his name but I would come back just for his welcoming personality. 110% worth every penny. Next time you want to celebrate or just have a delightful night out, do yourself a favor and go to Le Messe","Candace H.","I had a wonderful experience at Le Messe for Seattle restaurant week. Their interior is simple and beautiful. Definitely looks like a fancy restaurant, they have a high table area that surrounds their kitchen so you could choose to sit there and watch them cook. We didn't do that since we were a group of four and that would've been hard to have a conversation.
They do an AMAZING Beef Tartare. This is a must get item; the bread that the tartare is on top of comes warmed and toasty and the flavor of the beef is spot on. I think it was my favorite of the night!
Their smoked fish is also super good, comes on warm toasted bread as well and I would highly recommend trying it.
Other than that, we had their grilled halibut and pork. Their proteins are cooked to perfection as well with wonderful components to their dish that provides great textures and flavors.
They didn't have any pasta on their SRW menu but I hope to come back to try them because it all looks amazing!
We tried their dessert and we were at first skeptical of the triple cheese dessert but the honey and cheese and almonds was a surprisingly wonderful mix! They had homemade gelato as well and that was delicious! Their chocolate mousse was my favorite, it came with candied orange and flaky sea salt on the top. So creamy and smooth and chocolatey :p
Our server was very helpful and patient with us as we kept talking and forgot to look at the menu at the beginning!","Clint W.","Wow. We had a great dinner.
The veggies with the crab was bright, citrusy and spot on. Short ribs were super tender and just wonderfully put together. I actually thought the pasta was the dish I liked least, and it was merely good.
Le Messe is a little more difficult for me to get to, but I will be a repeater here. I'm a big fan of Vendemmia, but I really liked Le Messe.","Victoria S.","rarely do I give five stars ratings but this place deserves it. Great location in the lake union Seattle area. Servings are small but didn't lack in taste! They make their pasta right in the restaurant. Menu have French sounding names but let me describe, Dungeness crab pasta is a must try. And the other one is similar to ravioli with taste of a burst of lime, and basil and mushrooms and parmesan cheese and it was excellent. Service was amazing and let your server educate you on what is best and what is on the menu if you are a first timer. Price is fairly reasonable for the ambiance, service and selections. Don't forget to try their dessert menu! We had what they call warm ice cream / yogurt drizzled in pistachios and it was the best!","Hayley M.","Perfect restaurant! Great food and ambiance. A nice, unique menu. I will certainly be back. Squid ink pasta was delicious.","Sheryl K.","It was the first time trying Le Messe. One of my favorite cuisines is Italian food and pasta, so I was excited to have dinner here.
We ordered the hamachi crudo to start (this was light and refreshing). And for our entree's, we ordered the tagliatelle, which had Dungeness crab, creme fraiche, celery, and chives. And also the bucatini, with chanterelle, oregano, parmigiano, and egg yolk. Unfortunately I couldn't try the tagliatelle because I'm allergic to crab. But my bucatini was pretty tasty. The egg yolk definitely makes all the difference in making the dish creamy and rich. It's one of my favorite Italian dishes to have. We also ordered some bread, which was $5.
The food was pretty good, at least, what I was able to try. But overall, nothing really stood out to me where I would want to return for more.
The service could've been a little better. Our server seemed nice but very robotic. He didn't really come to check on us as often as he probably should've. Didn't really give us any recommendations for both dinner and dessert. He just came to take our order, bring our food, clean our table, and bring our check. Sadly, our dining experience here was just, alright.
If you don't mind dry service, I would at least check out the food here. We might've ordered things that weren't their specialty/popular. But for us, the food wasn't bad; it just wasn't amazing.","Thao N.","I'm not an expert in Italian food, came here for a birthday party because we need a nice restaurant for an excuse to dress up. Our party was 18 people deep, the bill was about $600 total after tax and tip, so for about $30 a head, it wasn't a bad experience. The menu changes every day depending on what they have that day. The entrees here were one of those smaller portion, artistic dishes, pleasing for the eye to look at type of deal. It's pasta so after so many pasta dishes, it does fill you up. My favorite was the agnolotti, it had the best flavor and I love mushrooms in general.
The restaurant is medium size, but spacious with the option to sit at the chef's table where you can watch them cook. They are only open for dinner 5-10pm daily. Perfect for date nights, girls night out, or business dinner. Located at a corner, parking was easy enough during this hour, but then again I did got a parking ticket since after a certain time you have to have a permit, but that's my fault for not reading signs right.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)","Elizabeth L.","Tasty handmade pasta with excellent service. Excellent happy hour menu features a trio of house pastas including the squid ink pasta, agnoletti (special) and rigatoni. Rigatoni was outstanding, highly recommend. Squid ink spaghetti was ok - al dente pasta, but dish needed more kick and flavor. Happy hour oysters are $2 each. Drink menu has decent cocktails - will be back for tasty pasta and awesome service!","Marc L.","Really enjoyed my meal here. I'd heard good things about their pasta offerings as well as their roasted chicken. I sampled the bucatini with braised pork shank and the chicken accordingly. The bucatini was decadent, perfectly al dente, and contained some red onions which really cut the fattiness of the pork nicely. The chicken was also excellent, the crispy skin was complemented beautifully by a rich parsnip celery puree. My server was also very attentive without being overbearing. Definitely want to come back to try more of their pasta offerings and small plates!","Linh L.","An airy, light-filled, Italian restaurant.
Everything was ordered from their Happy Hour menu (daily 5-6p & 9-10p, bar only).
For starters, we had a dozen of their daily oysters, which were the Purple Mountains from Hood Canals. We also ordered the Ahi Crudo, Springs Greens, and Beef Tartare. The ahi crudo was delicious, with a fresh citrus taste and a good sprinkle of coarse salt. I also loved the spring greens which came with a huge mound of parmesea, so good. The tartare was okay and only came out with three pieces of small toast.
For mains, we ordered the daily fish (Halibut), daily steak (Snake River Zabuton), and the Squid Ink Spaghetti. The fish was delicate and delicious, cooked perfectly. The steak came out medium-rare, with more emphasis on rare. I thoroughly enjoyed both of these dishes. However, I thought the squid ink spaghetti was lackluster and under-seasoned. We did not order it with the extra bottarga (salted, cured fish roe). In hindsight we definitely should have but since our waiter did not mention anything about it. On a positive note, there was a lot of spaghetti.
Overall, I liked most of these dishes. I did notice that the portions seemed small (particularly for the tartare and daily steak, which had 4 slices). Maybe since all dishes were from the HH menu. The service was also just okay.","Matthew L.","Have been here twice. First time, last summer, was great. Happy hour menu restaurant and ambience was perfect.
Came back last night to celebrate a birthday and had just an odd, expeexperience. Restaurant was 4/5 empty. They sat us in the bar area which we wanted so we could do happy hour menu. What's too bad is they have this super aggressive outdoor lighting that shines like a flashlight on the tables in that area and is pretty much an ambience killer. So we asked if we could sit anywhere else. Server was frankly a little rude and then moved us over to another seat about 5 feet away. Then he took the happy hour menus away and said he couldn't serve those to us since we had left the bar area. Sorry but... why are you making this awful guest experience ... I suggested that felt a little silly and the answer I got back was ""I don't control this I'm just a server"".
Which of course sucks for everyone.
Food was delicious that's not the issue. They could not have been nicer to our daughter.
The issue seems to be with the owners who have apparently disempowered their teams from being customer centric. I felt a little bad for the servers. Which are all the wrong emotions to be having when you're out for a nice night!
Also music - not sure why but it was some top 40 crap. Seattle restaurants HAVE to please up their music game. I spend $200+ on dinner to be inspired.
Just a bummer for a restaurant we really want to love!","Terri W.","Went to Le Messe last night; four of us ordered the Four-Course Tasting Menu. Here's the rundown of what we got:
App 1. Beets w/oil-cured olives and Marcona almonds in a vinaigrette: Very tasty.
App 2. Hamachi Crudo (Hamachi fish, served raw) with shaved kumquat, chilis, and celery: Good, but a bit too mild in flavor.
App 3. Fresh mozzarella slices topped with some kind of chunky orange-red sauce (not sure what it was): this was my least favorite dish -- pretty blah, under-salted, and the flavor and appearance of the orangey-red stuff on top of the cheese was utterly unidentifiable; the only thing I could identify were some mustard seeds. I didn't care for this dish much.
App 4. Delicata Squash with Rapini and black olive: the squash was delicious, but the rapini was pretty bitter, even for rapini.
App 5. Salad of leaf lettuce with candied pecans, freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and balsamic vinaigrette. Very tasty.
Pasta 1. Cacio e Pepe Pasta (rigatoni w/cheese and pepper) with actual/real white truffle (not ""truffle oil""): Very delicious! Given that (I believe) they make their pasta fresh every day, I expected a more delicately-textured pasta. It was a little on the thicker, sturdier side, which wasn't a bad thing - it's just that I wasn't expecting that. However, it was fully cooked, yet remained al dente. I actually liked the chewier texture. The sauce is made of Pecorino Romano and black pepper -- with the added bonus of white truffle -- and served with more grated cheese on top - yummy!!!
Pasta 2. Agnolotti (a stuffed pasta) that was filled with short rib, served with Delicta squash and either hazelnuts or Marcona almonds. Very delicious.
Protein 1. Sea Scallops, with parsnip-and-celery root puree, and fried parsnip chips, in Salmoriglio (a Southern Italian condiment made of lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, chopped oregano and parsley, salt, and pepper). Good, but not great in my opinion. The scallops seemed to be properly cooked, with a good sear on at least one side, but it seemed under-seasoned, and something in the dish tasted a little bitter.
Protein 2. Short Ribs. I loved them, but I'm very partial to short ribs, so I may not be very objective. Everyone seemed to like them, but maybe not as much as I did.
Dessert 1. Chocolate Brownie, with sea salt, whipped cream, almonds, and a raspberry sauce: Good; the sea salt made it better.
Dessert 2. Mascarpone Cake with roasted (or poached?) plums and whipped cream. Good.
It's a small restaurant, but when we got there (5:30) it was still fairly empty, so it wasn't noisy. However, a large group that arrived a little later was seated next to us, and they were very noisy. The décor is all hard surfaces, so it was very loud. This is a downside, in my opinion.
Also, we were there for a long time - over 3 hours. So, the hard bench seat we were sitting on was getting pretty hard by then, if you know what I mean. Fortunately, we didn't get any dirty looks or vibes indicating that we really needed to move along, and I appreciate that. (I was keeping an eye on the host station to see if people were waiting to be seated, and I never saw that happen, so I guess we lucked out.)
When we're in the mood for pasta, we'll put this place on our list of options, so we may well come back some time. But I'm not feeling that ""I've just GOT to come back again for sure!"" In other words, we all enjoyed our food (every dish went back to the kitchen completely empty) and we were satisfied with our experience, but it didn't send me over the moon.","Allie M.","Been here twice now - for regular menu once and the tasting menu as well. Each time the food has been absolutely amazing. Haven't eaten anything bad here. On the regular menu during the fall, we had some foie gras mousse which may gave been one of the best things I have ever eaten. The crab tagliatelle is a close second. At the tasting menu, everything down to the salads, the pastas, pork and homemade gelato were perfection. So much food and well worth the price per person for what you get. This might be my favorite restaurant in Seattle.","Lisa Y.","Had a bad experience at the restaurant tonight.
It was our daughter's birthday today so I called the restaurant and asked them if we can bring a birthday cake. The guy who answered the phone said sure, bring it in.
He never informed us about the cake fee and later we were charged $12 for cutting us 3 pieces of cake. It is ok if you want to charge $4 for cutting every piece of cake, but you should at least store the cake properly.
But no, our nice chocolate mousse cake from Regent bakery was pretty much melted and ruined when the server brought it up. None of the other nice restaurants in Seattle make mistakes and ruin important occasions like this.
Extremely disappointed!"
"Fiasco","https://www.yelp.com/biz/fiasco-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jazmin S.","I met up with some girlfriends who recommended this place to me. I arrived first and ordered myself the Spiced Apple Fizz to drink. OMG that drink is so good. Not too heavily spiced and not too overly strong alcohol. Be careful though because too many and who knows what will happen! LOL! Friends arrived and I of course ordered another Fizz....yum. Our meals were equally as delicious I had the Bolognese which was so flavorful and delicately beautiful. My friend had the Italian chopped salad and the squash bisque which was equally simple but packed with flavor. To end our meal we ordered the zeppoli (mini doughnuts) that came with three sauces. I will definitely be back to try the pizza I saw and get more of the zeppoli and Fizz drink.
Mangiamo!","Kenny G.","Wow, what a difference between our last time and this weekend, 7 months later. DISASTER! Went there with seven other members of my family to celebrate 6 birthdays of our 8 person party, and the kitchen couldn't get our food out to us in less than 75, yes 7-5, minutes. No, it wasn't busy, in fact half empty at 615p on Saturday night - not a great sign anyway. During this eternity, we were told the entrees would be right out two separate times, while no manager came to ask what he could do, offer drinks or even complimentary bread. My 86 year old mother commented that it was even worse service than at her rest home. When they finally got some entrees out to us, 3 of the 8 took additional time. The pasta was warm, but not hot, but we were exhausted by that time and just dealt with it.
Server, Phil, was apologetic but the damage had been done. I picked the restaurant, and was embarrassed by the ""fiasco"". In the end, they comp'd 30% off the bill, but with so many choices in Seattle, it would take an extraordinary circumstance for is to return. Maybe the company that owns Fiasco and Pablo y Pablo is the issue, since you either have a culture of serving your customer, or you don't!
Pity...","Jessica R.","Was really excited to try this spot, but sorely disappointed. Somehow they ruined calamari (so salty even my 8 year old wasn't into it and you could barely taste the squid under all of the breading). Risotto was okay, but underwhelming.
I enjoy a nice ambiance but it was incredibly loud and so dark that the entire restaurant had their phones out in order to read the menu (average age seemed to be mid 30s).
Skip it, go to San Fermo or Piccolino's and your money will be much better spent.","Teresa L.","I must say, this is one of the better Italian restaurants in the Seattle area that's open for lunch.
Came here on a Friday about 15 minutes after they opened. Walked in and was greeted immediately by a friendly server. We were in a hurry so told the server we would like to do take out. She handed us a lunch menu which was simple but had a decent selection of dishes.
We decided on a combo: chop salad with a 6in personal size classic pepperoni pizza. The other dish we selected was the Bucatini with meatball & red sauce.
After we placed our orders, we perused their large wall of wines that were on display. This restaurant has the largest wine selection I've ever seen. After a few minutes, we took a seat on these oversized leather seats. They were actually quite comfortable.
Then our orders came out relatively quickly. Immediately, I got a whiff of that cheesy pepperoni pizza. Almost instantly, my stomach began to speak to me saying, feed me! So, I did.
The pizza's crust was thin and cooked perfectly where it wasn't too crispy nor burnt. It had just the right amount of red sauce. Also, loved the small pepperoni where they curled up into tiny little cups. The best part was the cheese. It was cheesy enough where I had to stretch my arm out while the cheese refused to separate itself from the bite I took.
Next the chop salad! This salad was loaded with chunky salami, cubed provolone cheese, kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes, sliced pepperoncini, and fresh crispy lettuce. It was served with a refreshing slightly sweet and a little tart dressing. Absolutely delicious!
Finally, the Bucatini meatballs with red sauce. Initial thought after first bite: wow, this dish is flavorful! The red sauce didnt look like much but it was tasty, it even had a tiny spicy kick to it. That surprised me but in a very pleasant way. The noodles were cooked just the way I like it: al dente. Also, the meatballs were just as delightful. They were well seasoned and had a bounce to each bite.
I am definitely coming back to this restaurant to try other dishes. Also, would recommend this place to all the pasta and pizza lovers out there! Bon appetito!","Christy W.","Great Italian option in the Fremont area. I appreciated the gluten free pasta option (I asked for gluten free pasta with a dairy free red sauce, and they were easily able to accommodate).
There's a large ""wine wall"" in the front of the restaurant where they display tons of different bottles of wine. If you don't want one of the standard bottles of wine offered on the menu, you're able to walk over to the giant wine rack and choose a bottle you wish to drink that night! I thought it was a unique, interactive concept.","Michelle R.","Loved.every.moment!
We sat outside on a nice Seattle evening, enjoying the street chatter. When we ordered our drinks, I couldn't decide and was toying with several of the champagne cocktails, but settled on Prosecco. Our waiter offered to bring me one of the cocktails, the Rinomato, and if I didn't like it he would gladly swap it out. I loved that option, and ended up enjoying his drink recommendation.
We were surprised to find that our waiter brought us a complimentary appetizer, a Prosciutto Bruschetta - PHENOMENAL! Hubs said it was one of his top 5 appetizers ever!! It was topped with mascarpone, prosciutto, basil and honey. It was a wonderful flavor combo!
For my entrée, I selected the Chicken Piccata. It was buttery goodness, lemon was not overpowering and the entrée was very filling. Hubs got a pizza, I didn't hear any complaints.
Even though I was stuffed and very sastified, we ordered donuts for the table. They came with (espresso?) chocolate and caramel sauce and we LOVED them.
I'll gladly be back! Great atmosphere, delicious eats and EXCELLENT service!","Steve T.","I'd been here with some friends when it was Thackeray. I didn't have a good experience, so I never went back. However, once it became Fiasco, I'd wanted to give it another shot.
So, a few coworkers and I took some clients out to lunch and selected Fiasco as our location. In from South Korea, we wanted them to have a great experience. Unfortunately, it seems this location is still the same as it ever was.
As soon as we arrived, we were told the kitchen was backed up despite the restaurant only being half full. The biggest offense though was the giant hair one of the clients found in their salad.
Once we notified the waiter, he didn't even apologize. He simply took it back to the kitchen and we had to wait another 15 minutes for a replacement to come out. And when it did finally come out, it was once again without any sort of apology. They still charged us for his meal too.","Katrina M.","Went for dinner with friends tonight and really liked this place a lot!
The salads are the best thing in the menu, and the two we had were the Chinky Avocado and the Peach Panzanelle (I may have spelled that wrong).
The avocado salad was filled with chunks of creamy avocado and had a toasted quinoa, which was really delightful. The dressing was yummy and one of the best salads I've had.
The peach salad was tangy and I loved it as well. Not real sure where the peach cane in, but still great all the same.
We also had several of the pastas and the grilled chicken piccata. The pasta and zucchini that came with the chicken piccata were the best part...something addictive with the zucchini seasoning, and although it was really good, the chicken breast was pretty standard.
While I really enjoyed dinner here, I'd like to come back instead for happy hour because a lot of great things on that menu including the avocado salad, and the salads are the real winners here!","Jenny Z.","Friendly staff and food was tasty, but the value equation was way off. We started with calamari which was very lightly battered and tasted fresh but a very small portion for $12. I ordered a meatball sandwich no bun which came with a nice arugula salad. Came with six meatballs which I was surprised by! My husband got spicy shrimp polenta. The total was $73 with no drinks. The spicy shrimp polenta came with 5 small pieces of shrimp which is absurd for a $25 dish that is mostly cornmeal. The spicy sauce was really good though.
We came here when it used to be Thackeray and liked it too but did feel it was overpriced. This place (still same restaurant group) is even more overpriced it seems.","Ioanna I.","I have been here at least ten time with my friend as our local watering hole, and the we love it. The bartenders are so skillful. I have been introduced to so many different cocktails. I am vegan and there a lot of vegan options as well. If I could give it more stars I would. The vibe is also super modern and musky lighting.","Jaclyn F.","Came here for dinner and it was ok. Ordered the gnocchi and added chicken to it. The gnocchi was ok and I was surprised by how much chicken was given. The best part of the meal was definitely the dessert. The tiramisu and the zeppoles were delicious! I would probably skip dinner here next time, but would potentially try brunch. It is definitely a step up from Thackeray","Savannah S.","Great happy hour spot!
The pie + glass of wine for $13 is a steal.
We also got the bread and garlic w/ oil, which was delicious - fabulous bread! The fried artichokes were also delicious, not a super common menu item so was nice to try.
The pizza is delicious, the happy hour size is small but with other apps it is fine. Crispy, thin crust! The wine was alright, but not great.
Excellent service - the waitress dropped one of our pizzas and brought a complimentary salad while they made a new one, which was out moments later.
Would definitely return for happy hour or pizza!
Service 5/5
Food 5/5
Drinks 4/5
Atmosphere 5/5 (very large but cool decor)","Seth O.","First time trying out Fiasco and was well worth the trip. Very comfortable space that can fit a lot of people without being too crowded. The service was great between helping decide on a bottle a wine that you can grab from the wine bar as well knowing all aspects of there menu to decide on what your in the mood for. My wife and I decided on the prosciutto bruschetta to start and each got a pasta dish. You can taste the quality of all the food with each bite. Great spot for a date night or meet up with a group of friends","Melissa M.","What a nice place!! The server here was super fun and friendly and explained what can be made vegan and my options were great! I would definitely go back.","Amanda R.","I was a fan of Thackeray and was a little surprised to see it's a totally different restaurant!
Same outdoor seating and the interior is bright and colorful with a beautiful bar.
I was a party of 3 whom sat outside. Service was good for the most part; our waitress was lovely but did get slammed multiple times inside so there were moments we were left patiently waiting...
We took advantage of HH for the most part. My phone died before I could photograph all items but here's a breakdown.
-Olives were good, nice citrusy flavor. I've had better but I've had less awe inspiring olives so I would suggest giving them a try.
-Broccolini has a nice flavor, maybe slightly vinegary, but the roasted garlic was a nice touch. There were only 4 pretty thin pieces though so the portion size to price was kind of a bummer.
-Olive bruschetta with goat cheese was yummy. Awesome charred bread and lovely flavor from the toppings. Again, the portion for the price was a little disappointing. Not much of a bite when shared with 3 people.
-Chunky avocado salad, must try!! We loved the vinaigrette mixed with the frisée and generous amount of avocado with pepitas (slightly too salty) and crispy quinoa. Mmmm
-My friend said the Gnocchi was really good; nice texture and a delicious red sauce. Very flavorful.
-Goaty goat goat pizza was great! I love their crust, thing and crispy with a bit of chew. The flavor was fantastic. Highly recommend if you enjoy goat cheese.
Overall, we had a great experience at fiasco. Docked a star only for the moments of lackluster service and (too) small appetizer portions.","Brittany S.","I won a pizza party at Fiasco for myself and 9 friends. None of us had been here before and came with moderate expectations. We were all thrilled with the ambiance, food and especially the service. The servers went above and beyond to check in while still giving us the space to enjoy the evening. We also appreciated Claret, the adjacent wine bar, where we could hand select wine to enjoy at the restaurant or take home for a lower price. We left excited to come back and enjoy more items on their menu as well as to take advantage of several of their specials they run throughout the week.","Rachel C.","We went on a Friday evening. The service was excellent. Food was just as great. They fresh make the pasta and all the bread/pizza dough, the cheese bread is a must order.
Will definitely recommend this place and come back.","David P.","Stopped in on opening night and tried out a pizza and a salad. The Don Rafa pizza was a sizeable pizza for one person, and or a good size to share with two people along with a salad if you aren't too hungry. The pizza was a thin crust and had a good flavor profile. The lettuce gem salad was well tossed and crisp.
The restaurant is still owned by the same owners that previously occupied the space and the restaurant itself is a large, open, beautiful space.
Will stop back to try the pastas next time.","Vaishali K.","Went there for restaurant week! The three course meal was very good and portion sizes were very sufficient. I loved the pasta! Highly recommend it! Also, love the ambience of the place!","Neha M.","Downright underwhelming and overly expensive for what they have to offer. I used to like Thackery somewhat - at least their menu was interesting. Fiasco replaced it. While the location and ambience are nice, Fiasco's menu, prices and taste is below average. We had calamari and a pizza. Nothing memorable. Decided not to do the dessert. I heard the wine selection is good but I personally didnt try."
"How To Cook a Wolf","https://www.yelp.com/biz/how-to-cook-a-wolf-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Amira J.","was 100% dedicated to eating this pasta i was given as a take out meal. wow, when i say dedicated i mean i was real serious about savoring each & every flavor!
firstly, i AM NOT a huge red pasta fan but this dish was so promising that i might be turning to the red side. i cannot believe it was this good because sometimes take out can taste different from when you dine in so i can't imagine how good this was dining in!
i got the lamb & beef bolognese rigatoni pasta that was topped with some fine n dandy mozzarella. (y'all)
this was by far the best red sauce pasta i've had. so many intentional flavors that gave my taste buds a dance party. like seriously this was great quality pasta & it wasn't dry! it was good, saucy & had a kick to it. i appreciate this pasta so much & i will be coming back here for more. next visit i will be sure to dine in :)
small portions, but good bc the flavors are SO POWERFUL!","Phil G.","This well known restaurant in Queen Anne is owned by one of members of Seattle's restauranteur cartel, who own and operate an amalgam of successful, popular restaurants in Seattle. The cartel members with names such as Erickson, Douglas, Dillon, and in this case Stowell, open and close restaurants seemingly at will. All have a following, and all
seem to make money. Some I like, some are just okay. How to Cook A Wolf, even with its obnoxious name, tries hard to please.
The staff is pleasant, catering to the young clientele, playing hip hop and rap loudly on the sound system. The place is tiny, and thus the music was the star on this chilly Sunday night. As always, we sat at the bar and our server, although a bit saccharin and ""over the top,"" was
professional and friendly. The crispy duck leg was fantastic, but the portion very small. My requested classic cace e pepe pasta was overwhelmed by the peppercorns. While the pasta was cooked al dente, the over powering pepper almost made the dish in eatable. My wife began coughing after one taste and waved it off. I ate the pasta because I wanted her to enjoy the duck leg.
Surprisingly, I enjoyed How To Cook A Wolf more than my wife, who was appalled at the pasta; she being Italian. Hey, the kitchen hit 500, that's okay, and makes me want to try it again.","Edward S.","I had been to other Ethan Stowell restaurants, but this was this first time I drove up Queen Anne hill to eat here. I thought the meal was excellent and I will need to return soon.
His restaurants always have excellent wine lists. Here I ordered the Savage Grace cab franc and it was excellent. The menu consists of small plates and large plates--although some of the small plates are not so small.
I started with Brussels Sprouts and the Burrata. The Brussels sprouts came with a vinaigrette and bread crumbs and were cooked wonderfully. Then I really loved the burrata, it tasted so good on the fennel crackers that came with it.
I had two pastas for large plates, the rigatoni and the tagliarini. Both were good, but I preferred the rigatoni. The lamb and beef bolognese sauce that came with it was incredible then the fresh pasta is so delicious. The pasta with the tagliarini was also great and that dish came with some great mushrooms.
Although I was pretty full, I had the cannoli for dessert. It is a generous one that I could not finish. The shells were flaky and just perfect, but the pistachio cream was out of this world. This was a great dining experience overall.","Parisa E.","This is a very cute cozy restaurant in upper queen anne!
Perfect date night spot or girls night out for small plates to share. Try to get 4-6 dishes for 2 people we ordered 4 plates and one pasta to share which was a great portion. The atmosphere is romantic yet still fun! Quite cozy so plan to sit close to your neighbors. Service was wonderful and they actually help you balance your order not just trying to up-sell you. Get a reservation in advance so worth it!!","Jared M.","Fantastic tapas bar with awesome service! Came here to welcome my sister moving to Seattle and can't wait to come back.
We started off with the tomatoes, burrata, and shishito peppers and all were good but the burrata was my favorite. It came with salted crisps and some lightly mashed tomato which blended well with the burrata, cutting the richness and adding a complex variety of flavor. The tomatoes were super fresh served on top of reduced balsamic with some basil spread on top and were very tasty. Shishito peppers are always amazing and they found a nice way to distinguish with the crisped bread crumbs and artichoke and while good weren't the best served.
For entrees we split the short rib pasta and the salmon. The salmon was spectacular with crisped edges and served on a great sauce with veggies. The pasta was also super fresh and the short rib added a lot of flavor.
Great spot and will be back when it's not booked the whole night!!","Lacey G.","Such a lovely visit to my favorite neighborhood spot. I've been here many times & each visit is so great. The staff is just wonderful, always happy to help & just overall attentive without being over bearing. We had the squash dish, the cauliflower dish & the scallops 10/10 recommend ALL of them! My hubby is a chef & they tend to be a little picky about things, he was blown away by everything.
The cocktails were SO delicious as well, I highly recommend the beet infused one.","Jill S.","This place is absolutely fantastic. Service is excellent, portion sizes are great (not too small, which I often worry about with tapas), and dear god the food is good. Wait, not good - fantastic.
Get the squash for a starter - you won't be disappointed.
I cannot wait to go back when I'm in town next!","Bob R.","Small, amazing tapas restaurant! We went before PNB Nutcracker, and it was the perfect prequel to a romantic night on the town. Great location, too, with plenty of nearby shops to enjoy. Great service, amazing food, excellent wine selection. I highly recommend.","Stacy P.","I've had this on my list for over a year now, and now that I live here, I had to make it a point to get in. I understand the process better now, as the restaurant is fairly small, so there aren't too many reservations to be had. We got in on a Monday night, 7:45 reservation. 3 of us.
Sat at the corner table by the window. Note: wear your jacket. There's a reason why there is a rolled up carpet cutting off the draft from the floorboards. I was basically cuddling up with my friend on her leg. lol
The server was pleasant, but distracted. They were understaffed. Our waters came out, we ordered some plates to share, but I was in starvation mode, so I chose the sourdough for 3 to start. At $3 per piece of bread with an accompaniment of garlic and fennel honey butter.... should be good, right? Except two other dishes came out first, with you guessed it, toast pieces or crackers. By the time the bread got there, we had filled up on other carbs. I should've declined the late sourdough arrival.
Dish 1 - Burrata - English Peas, Mint, Fennel Cracker
This was very tasty and the burrata creamy, love the addition of the peas, they were bright and a fresh spring feel to the dish. A bit too much on the olive oil.
Dish 2 - Lamb Tartare - Anchovy Vinaigrette, Fresh Herbs, Garlic Toast
There were some lamb chunks that were sinewy and overall, way heavy handed on the oil. It was like Olive Oil took over. Two bites and I was done. Delightful presentation, but that's where that ended.
Dish 3 - The Sourdough Bread. I think I was already breaded out at that point. The honey butter with the one bite of bread I had was lovely.
Dish 4 - Polenta Fritters - Ricotta, Sage, Chestnut Honey
My favorite dish. Lightly crisp on the outside, and fluffy inside, nice and hot. Sat on top of a sweetly ricotta base and hints of sage. Well done. Bravo!
Dish 5 - Tagliatelle - Wild Ramp, English Pea, Egg Yolk, Prosciutto Brodo
Tasty. Noodles stuck together though. Boring dish overall. Nothing stood out. Next.
Dish 6 - Strozapretti - Pork Belly, Tomato, Calabrian Chili, Pecorino
Tastiest dish of all the dishes. Pork belly was a shade stiff. Still some residual olive oil taste though. Server said the dish would be spicy, it wasn't spicy in the least bit. Definitely the more tasty of the two pastas.
My opinion, overpriced for the quality of food. Bread should always come out first. My palate was so ""olive oil'd"" I'm surprised I didn't get Popeye'd as I left!","Kayesee S.","Wow this place is really special.
I made a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday and we both had a wonderful time. The gave us a complimentary glass of champagne because it was his birthday, and put a candle on our dessert. It's those type of details that really make a difference.
The food was also out of this world. You have to try their pasta and the bruschetta is also a not to miss item! I will be back again!","Austin H.","This is an amazing restaurant and I loved everything about it. My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and it definitely lived up to my expectations. Upon arrival we were greeted with glasses of champagne to celebrate my birthday. We followed that up with some delicious cocktails, I ordered the Patio Season and my gf ordered their house sangria.
As good as the drinks and the cozy dining space were the food was still the star. We got six total items counting dessert. Sea Wolf Sourdough with roasted garlic and fennel honey butter was an amazing start. That came out at the same time as the Hamachi Crudo, which while tasty and wonderful to eat on warmer days would probably be the thing I'd cut first for next time as I'd rather try another pasta or maybe a seasonal small plate. To follow those we had the Smoked Salmon Bruschetta with pickled shallots. Then came the mains. The Cassareccia pasta was absolutely sensational. The short rib was so tender and flavorful while the carrot sofrito gave it some spice. The cheese on top gave it a nice balance. The pasta was a perfect al dente and this was the highlight of the meal for me. A very close second place would go to the Beelers Pork Belly that followed. The pork was fatty yet crispy. The peaches and shishitos that accompanied it were a nice touch and the romesco sauce was heavenly and brought the whole dish together. Both of these mains are must orders as long as they are on the menu and you have an appetite for meat.
After all of this we were feeling full but wanted a sweet treat to end the evening so we split the lemon tart with blueberry frozen yogurt as it seemed like a good choice with the sun setting on us as we closed out our evening. They even served it with a candle on top for me! The service was wonderful throughout the night and we will definitely return. Ethan Stowell continues to be one of my favorite chefs around as his restaurants deliver in every way.","Dasha W.","The hype is legitimate! This place is incredible from food to great friendly genuinely happy-to-be-there wait staff. Took a friend visiting from Philly here last night and we ordered the gnocchi with red sauce (absolutely to die for and that's coming from a person who usually doesn't pick this type of dish) and a mushroom pasta (deliciously savory with a peppery lasting impression on your tongue that impressed me with every bite!) This will be a regular spot for special occasions like friends in town for me!","Veronica B.","Came here for a fancy date night while on vacation with my husband, and this place did not disappoint. What I can't stress enough is that the service is absolutely AMAZING. It's probably the best service I've ever received in a restaurant ever. Period. Hands down. Our server could've recited the entire menu from memory, never needed to write our orders down, was able to suggest pairings of drinks, appetizers, and desserts, and had everything timed perfectly, so we could enjoy the pace of the meal. What an experience.
The inside space is small (definitely make a reservation if you can), but it has elegant, yet homey vibes, with cozy lighting and decoration to keep the atmosphere perfect for a date night, but appropriate for a business dinner. The drink menu is exquisite, with some of the most unique cocktail combinations ever. All that I tried were delicious.
The portions are small - the menu is clearly meant to sample and share, but if you're bold and looking to try what's available, this place is an absolute must. It's also in a great location, with surprisingly easy parking, and some of the most flavorful and delicious bites I had on my entire trip.","Jeremy S.","After having a poor experience at a different Ethan Stowell restaurant, I am compelled to write an updated review of How to Cook a Wolf. I decided to visit here last night with my friend, and once again the food and service was fantastic!
We were seated at the bar after calling with a 10 min notice and was accommodated. The host was very polite and sat us at our seats while introducing us to the bartender who was friendly and kind. The bartender walked us through the different drinking options. It was great that he offered to even surprise us if we were in the mood to try something new. We told him that we were open to trying something new and he asked what kind of alcohol base we enjoy and if we preferred more alcohol or fruity tastes. It was entertaining to watch him create the drinks and put them together. He explained the drinks to us and they tasted amazing!
We then ordered the broccoli, polenta fritters (my favorite!), the bread, the mushroom gnocchi and chocolate budino. The menu had recently changed so the pasta and dessert were great surprises!
Overall, I loved the service as usual, loved the food, and I will continue to be a returning customer here!","John O.","This is a good place but well below great. The menu looks really good but the execution is a few steps off. Love the neighborhood and the space is super tiny. Service was ok, casual but effective. Wine list has some finds on it. Had a good meal here but I wouldn't return.","Victoria G.","Definitely need a reservation place. Small and cozy inside, it was a little bit loud (in case you are looking for more privacy). Our server was great, and we enjoyed tasting different things on the menu. Would highly recommend!","Alyssa A.","I've had this restaurant on my wish list of places to try for a long time so there was much anticipation when I finally made a reservation a few months back. And yes, make a reservation. The restaurant is small and has a great reputation so if you want to guarantee your dining experience here, plan ahead.
Started out with drinks from a collection of original cocktails. I had to try the Professor Burgess as that's my family's surname and it was perfect.
The food was spectacular. Polenta fritters over ricotta, a beet salad with crumbles of cheese and my personal favorite, bruschetta with mushrooms. The pork belly over grits was perfectly cooked and moist. I recommend the ravioli as well.
We did our best not to lick the plates clean and to keep our groans of delight as soft as possible but I'm pretty sure we still managed to make a scene. Now I'm making plans to return and try all new dishes.","Cammy D.","This place is always packed and hard to get reservations, so we went right when they opened at 5 pm and got a seat at the bar. The service was excellent and the ambiance was also great! It's a quaint restaurant and perfect for date night! The black cod, gnocchi, and smoked cod potatoes were delicious!! The only item that we weren't too impressed with was the hamachi crudo as it didn't taste very fresh. I love raw fish (sushi, sashimi, etc.) but this had a funny/fishy aftertaste. Everything else was great!!","Dani T.","Delicious food, excellent service. Not much more to say than that.
Sourdough bread - 5/5
Comes with honey butter and roasted garlic in balsamic and olive oil. Absolutely delightful and must get for $2/person.
Beef carpaccio - 5/5
Great balance in this dish between the beef, greens, and mushrooms. Every bite was full of flavor and interesting texture.
Spaghetti Bolognese - 5/5
We had a late dinner so they actually ran out of the tagliatelle and kindly asked me if they could sub in spaghetti instead. The Bolognese sauce had such a great kick to it and the spaghetti was perfectly al dente. I'd come back to just eat this.
Sage Ravioli with pancetta - 4/5
Very flavorful! Actually it wasn't what we expected on first bite, but quickly grew to love it. Ended up using some of the sourdough to soak up all of the sauce to not let the leftover go to waste!
Service was efficient and thoughtful throughout. There are multiple places where they explain the automatic 20% surcharge attached so you're not caught off guard.","Tanya H.","I'd heard so many great things about this place and we finally got around to trying it.
The dining room is a bit like a sauna...in that it's all wood-panelled with very little art or other decor. It was cosy and cool...not that many covers which is why it's probably hard to get a table.
Start off with the sourdough bread. So yummy and I loved the fennel-honey butter it came with.
We then shared the red beet salad and the burrata. Both were very well-executed dishes with generous portions of beets and burrata, respectively. The burrata would probably be a little better served with bread rather than the crackers they provide. I then a chevre/nettle ravioli which was excellent.
Definitely go feeling hungry as you will definitely be full at the end. It's not cheap but not crazy expensive either and it's always great to have well-executed food."
"In Bocca Al Lupo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/in-bocca-al-lupo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Charlie C.","Have a look at this place, really nice inside. Hands down the second best pizza I've ever had after Sorbillo in Naples. Happy to find quality Italian food in Fremont. Highly recommend a bottle from the natural wine selection. Hadn't drank a bottle of wine without feeling it the next day, until this fine day. Have plans to get back here asap.","Jiwon C.","I really wanted to like it because of the good atmosphere and great location.
Food is under proportioned, overpriced, and tastes like very generic grocery store condiments are used. Our antipasto and pizza had a solid 30 minutes in between being served to us- takes way too long to be placed on our table.
The pizza was underflavored, undercooked yet overcooked in some parts, and very small? My party and I utilized the chili oil and chili flakes a little too much.
It also took our party several tries to get the server's attention to get the check. We were really polite the entire time and there was maybe one other party in the restaurant.
Out of everything the Saute di Vongole (Hama Hama mailla clams oven roasted in white wine) were probably the best.","Brian C.","I would give this place 5 stars for the quality but for the egregious prices of the pasta dishes, I have to take off a star for that kind of abuse on my wallet.
I went with a friend for happy hour and we ordered two happy hour pizzas. We thought they were a fair price for the size we got. Since the happy hour pizza wasn't enough for a substantial meal, we ordered the lasagna. When the waitress brought the dish, it was so tiny that I thought it was a happy hour portion even though it wasn't on the happy hour menu. Turns out that it was the regular dinner size lasagna for $16. It didn't come with a side of vegetables or even a slice of bread. For a small bar/restaurant, this crazy price was definitely a big surprise. But my friend and I both agreed that the pizza and the lasagna were good.
If you come in for the pizza that this place is known for, you'll walk away happy. Just don't get the ridiculously small size lasagna (other pastas on the menu are probably the same tiny portion) or your Italian grandma will be sad that you spent all that money and didn't get enough to eat.","Steve M.","I've been here several times, and I'm sure I'll be back again since I live nearby and it's convenient.
That said, I've found their pizzas to be inconsistent. Sometimes too charred, occasionally with a bit of ash from the wood fire, and they tend to under-top the pizzas. For instance, the Chanterelle Bianco I ordered had about one mushroom per slice, and parts of the slices had no toppings whatsoever, not even a bit of olive oil base).
That said, you usually can't go wrong with their Pepperoni pizza.","Andrew H.","I think this is good but they burned the bottom a little too much for my taste. They have good sauce-cheese/basil proportion with more basil than usual. Their antipasti plates looked good and I would want to go back to try the blood orange salad. Where do you even get blood oranges in Seattle?","Jacqueline H.","We came in to In Bocca Al Lupo for my birthday dinner and had called ahead to make a reservation. They have a large table in the back of the restaurant that is perfect for about 10 people, so they were able to accommodate our party. We tried the almost every pasta on the menu and the margarita with burrata pizza, which was delicious! The Fernando pasta was amazing and highly recommended! We also had a couple of their cocktails (agrodulce and spritz) which were average.
Service from start to finish was great here and I would definitely recommend checking it out!","Nicholas C.","If you are in the Fremont district and want excellent pizza, atmosphere and service..... you should probably come here! My wife and I are in town for a book tour across the street and decided to swing by and grab wine and pizza!!! 100% amazing!! Loved it! We ordered one pizza to start but quickly ordered another. Awesome happy hour! Anytime we are back in town, we will come back! Highly recommended!!
Also... ask for their pepper infused oil for your pizza!!!! EXCELLENT!!","Melville P.","This place has great ambiance. The bartender will even make you an espresso late at night after the machine is clean. The Nutella calzone is a big winner at 6 bucks! The bruschetta was tasty, but a disappointment. It was two slices of toasted bread with ricotta and a few cherry tomatoes on top. That is not bruschetta and certainly wasn't filling or worth the price. They have a very nice drink list and I'm still anxious to try their special brick oven pizza.","Emma N.","My friend and I got a prosciutto pizza and a pesto pizza~ both with goat cheese instead of regular cheese. Both pizzas were delicious. :) Would definitely come back again!","Tazeen L.","The hunt for good wood fire pizza has finally ended with the discovery of in bocca, a cozy spot with great service and a solid list of pizzas to work through. Split a couple pies with a couple friends and it was the perfect amount...
-funghi- mushroom, ricotta, truffle... good balance of truffle flavor and good chewy crust
- burrata- solid red pie, shave of Parmesan added a nice salty bite
Plan to return very soon to try out the rest of the menu...","Christine P.","Favorite Italian spot in Seattle and I've tried a lot of places! Nothing on the menu has disappointed.","Angel B.","updating my review to 3 stars. the manager of this restaurant reached out to me explaining the style of their pizza and how it isn't for everybody, but that they were sorry that it wasn't communicated to us ahead of time. he also offered for me to come back to try some of their appetizers or entrees again. while i didn't follow up on this offer, i appreciate the excellent service and that they were willing to have me back to share some of their other menu offerings.","Tamiko D.","Justin made the complete experience for us! The food is sooo good! We started with the bruschetta, so creative and delicious. The burrata caprese was next and just as good. Then the fam shared the vingole pasta, the mushroom pizza and the margharita pizza. The dough was crispy chewy and full of flavor, my fave was the mushroom pizza with just a little bit of truffle oil! Most places overpower with truffle oil but this was juuuust right!
Next time we're in town this will be our go to place!","Gabe B.","I went there on a Wednesday afternoon with my friend right when it opened. We both got coppalina pies. The pizza was satisfying but not too heavy, and I didn't feel super tired after eating it, which is a big plus in my book. We shared the chocolate/ngutella calzone as well and that was great as well. Both of the owners were there and super friendly as well.","Julie C.","No bullshit, good food every time. My family loves this place and has for over a decade. It's one of the few restaurants in the city we all four walk away happy. Look no further. Worth your money and time. They were formally Via Tribunali, but this was the only Via Trib location we liked. My New York friends approve of their pizza and cannolis. We were so happy the location became a separate owned entity. Solid service, excellent food. Never disappoints.","Kaitlin Y.","The ambience of the restaurant is relaxing and great for people-watching if you're sitting on the patio during a nice night in Seattle. However, service was slow despite it not being too busy.
We ordered 2 arugula salads and a prosciutto crudo pizza between 2 of us, and a glass of the house red wine. The salad was okay, but it didn't come tossed. It only consisted of arugula, Parmesan, and lemon, with barely any olive oil. Although it was good, we expected that for the $8 we paid for each salad, they would have provided a bit more. We could have easily made the salad at home. I also wished there were entree-sized salad options for the purpose of sharing as an appetizer. In terms of the pizza, it came uncut and we had to cut the hot pizza ourselves with scissors. While it tasted good, we wish there was more cheese and was overall less soggy. The dough was good but the toppings ratio felt off. For what it was, we don't think the pizza was worth the $18.
Overall, the ambience was nice, but food was not worth the price.","Hannah Y.","This restaurant was very accomadating to our part 13, which was a HUGE plus! However, I was not a fan of the pizzas here. They did mention that their pizzas were meant to be eaten with a knife and fork but the pizzas were so soggy that it wasn't pleasant to eat regardless. I would recommend trying the pastas or calzones because those dishes seemed to be more appetizing!","Daniel B.","Food 4/5
Service 4/5
Ambiance 4/5
Overall 4/5
The burrata e pesto was delicious, but I wish they served more bread with it. Also would love an option for truffle oil. 4/5
Their pizza coppalina was the highlight of the meal, all the ingredients stood out, the sauce was a little too sweet, and the pizza dough was too thin to even support itself and resulted in all of the toppings and cheese on the plate. Still the pizza overall was good 4/5.
The lasagna was pretty underwhelming. First off the portion size definitely does not justify the price, especially with the lack of meat it had. The sauce was really sweet again, but the lasagna didn't feel heavy in the stomach. The pasta stood out the most, just wished that there was more meat and cheese. 3/5
A great place for a nice dinner date, definitely would go back to try more.","Marie B.","Catching up with belated Yelp posts, I stopped by In Bocca Al Lupo in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood back on 3/29/18.
With several restaurants all within a stone's throw from IBAL, I went in to give it a whirl. I really didn't care much for the former Via Tribunali (receipt still says VT), but decided to place an order for a basic Quattro Formaggi to go. When I finally got around to trying a slice...it was underwhelming. But then pizza flavor profiles are subjective to one's palate, I'm more of the Bar del Corso (Beacon Hill) or Veraci (Ballard, Wedgwood) varieties.
Should have ventured across the street to Fremont Bowl, especially what no line?!
Gave it a try, just not for me.","Kevin C.","Stopped on a whim - and what a find! Awesome bruschetta, great blood orange salad and maybe the best veal meatball I've ever had. This is the place you hope to find in a neighborhood you don't know."
"Osteria la Spiga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-la-spiga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Helen H.","I honestly loved this place. Came for a large group, friends dinner. The ambience and service was amazing and they were nice enough to split our bill at the end.
Sort of surprised that it's not that busy, felt the food was delicious and prices fair as well! Would definitely return!","Laverne M.","I've been here several times and IMHO the best thing on the menu is the Tagiatelle al Burro di Tartufo - pasta with white alba truffle butter. It's a great deal during HH. Other pasta dishes are very good as well.
The service has been mixed. I see the current menu on their website has changed from the past 3 times I've been there, one of the reasons I haven't been back in a while is because of the lack of variation in the menu. Just because I love their Tagiatelle al Burro di Tartufo doesn't mean my partner does.","Benjamin E.","Food...meh
Ambiance...hey
Service...bleh
Experience... flat
Attempted a small group dinner here to celebrate a birthday and was left with that well too known experience when you know there's a chef and staff behind the scenes working their ass off just to have the service side let the patron down. It was one of those meals where you wished you could've paid the bill prior to eating. You know the check will come at some point...and you'll have that weird feeling trying to justify a tip that you hope goes to those who deserve it.","Edward S.","Osteria la Spiga is an excellent Italian restaurant in the heart of Capitol Hill. The food is wonderful. The interior is really nice and modern with spacious wooden booths.
They have a really great wine list with a bunch of Italian wines. I am not that familiar with them, but the bottle I had was great. Service was a little slow because they were busy, but good.
The menu is very Italian also. I started with the Formaggi Misti cheese plate. The cheeses were absolutely wonderful and it was a great mix. I particularly loved the hard cheese--but I would have been tempted to order it twice in a night.
For my main course I had the Tortelli Del Capo--which were tortelli stuffed with ricotta and raisins. This was superb, the pasta and cheese tasted super fresh and the rosemary butter source was to die for, just fantastic.","Annie R.","My boyfriend and I came here last night for a nice New Year's Eve dinner. We were interested in the happy hour menu (a little broke from after the holidays) but they didn't end up serving hh on NYE. We were a little disappointed but decided to stay anyways and I'm so glad we did! We ordered this yummy platter as an hors d'oeuvres that had like cheese, eggplant, onion, prosciutto, in this like puffy bread thing, so yummy! And then he got some ravioli with mushroom and I had the sausage. His entree was definitely better than mine but mine was still good. The service was great as well although he was a little push yon us to drink or order more but overall enjoyed it and would come back.","Melody L.","Great Italian option in cap hill. Came here on a Friday for dinner and it wasn't too busy. Both the hostess and server were very friendly. The interior looks really nice with all the wood furnishing, and there is even an upper level and outdoor area in the back.
I had the Lasagne Verdi (spinach lasagna noodles layered with ragu bolognese, béchamel and parmigiano reggiano). It was honestly heavenly. At $19, it was just a little on the pricey side but definitely worth it. Unfortunately this place doesn't do complimentary bread, but you can buy some for only $3. We picked the ciabatta, which was a decent choice.","Caitlyn S.","Going off of yelp and just the photos I came in for dinner while I was visiting Seattle for the first time to try out the food that looked so good through photos. I was able to make a reservation for a Friday night super easily which was nice! We were sat right when we came in and our server came to ask for drinks but we weren't ready. When we were ready I had a question about the spritz, the server then said he was going to bring me a sample of the liquor I asked for and then my boyfriend asked for a beer but then the server said they were out of stock. When he brought the drinks back I ended up with an already made spritz, and no sample. I tried it out and ended up not liking it so I eventually told the server I wanted to get something else and he took the spritz off the bill, which was much appreciated.
Our appetizers were wonderful with great flavor, but kind of odd presentation with the paper on the board under the prosciutto. We ordered the tortellini di agnello and the gnochetti della fiera and were super excited to get them until they arrived poorly plated and the tortellini was missing multiple fillings inside the pasta itself. The desert was great!!!
Overall I think the restaurant had great potential, but I think it needs to work on the details more so to get the full five stars.","jazmine s.","Last Friday night decided to check this place out even though the reviews were less than stellar. I gotta say I was impressed. Great staff, food (lasagna, egg plant dish and wine) decor and ambience. The only thing that was terrible was the music. It did not fit the atmosphere, they were playing oldies including Mashed Potato song. We'll definitely be back!","Leela S.","I'd walked by Osteria la Spiga on plenty of occasions without ever stopping by. I finally had the chance to dine here recently. Turns out that the restaurant is significantly larger than you'd expect from the outside--once you enter, you're greeted by a rather expansive, high-roofed space that feels simultaneously classy and rustic.
The restaurant was able to accommodate our large group with an advance reservation. They recommended pre-ordering appetizers, so that's what we did (there was a moment of confusion among some folks when food that certainly didn't look complimentary began being placed on the table shortly after we arrived, heh). Both the wine and cocktail lists are solid. I highly recommend the Rhonda if you like negronis--made with Piedmontese gin and Carpano Antica, it was a delicious rendition of one of my favorite cocktails.
I ordered the Tortelli al Porcini as my entree, and really enjoyed it. I'm a sucker for mushrooms, and this dish was all about the mushrooms (including truffle butter!). Portion sizes were solid--a couple of people in the group ended up needing boxes because they couldn't finish (granted, we did order a healthy pile of appetizers). Service was pleasant without being overbearing, and they didn't rush us out as soon as we were done eating--it's nice to be able to linger without cutting off the conversation, especially when the restaurant clearly isn't too busy.
Overall, pretty solid meal! It's a quieter, more traditional Italian food experience than nearby Tavolata. The dishes specifically focus on Northern Italian cuisine, which is something I enjoyed. This is definitely a popular date spot based on other tables that were around us.","Christopher L.","Let's get right to the point...this place is amazing! The atmosphere is perfect for any celebration or just a night out. The staff are friendly and pay close attention to detail throughout service. The drinks are fantastic and they will even accommodate request. The bread service was delicious along with the Caprese. Next, the Polenta Fritta along with the Gnocchi Al Pomodoro was a great start to the meal followed by fantastic Costata Di Maiale. However, though that is a lot, let's not forget about the delicious Panna Cotta Con Lavanda to complete the meal followed with a delicious desert wine. There is nothing on this menu that you could go wrong with and this place is a must try again and again. Fantastic!","Kali H.","My husband and I went here for date night. The food was delicious and the live music was great!","Shaky S.","Excellent spot. Great Italian food. Beautiful astethics. The service is top notch.
I'd definitely do it again","Rachael B.","Great find! I was in Seattle for the first time and only there for two hours. My cousin's husband suggested we try this Italian spot. The décor has an industrial woodsy feel to it, which was very unique, hip, and inviting.
Unfortunately, all the pasta dishes with red sauce had pork in them and I couldn't eat them (as I don't eat pork), so I ordered the filet, which was delicious!
Our waitress was very friendly. The atmosphere is worth a visit!","Sasa S.","Great food, great service, great atmosphere... the prices though are just a lot. They even charged for bread and that seems mean for an Italian restaurant -- and all you get with it is oil. The papardelle was great and the salad with radicchio and eggplant was awesome but the salad was also $16 and not a full meal so. Special occasions only!","George K.","Bartenders Max and Dominique were amazing! Great reconditions and spot on customer service. 4 star just because of the Ho hum waitress for dinner. Great ambiance and solid food","Jennifer K.","With Seattle Restaurant Week coming to an end and a ton of restaurants still on the list to try, this made the top of the list. Situated near/ in(?) Chophouse Row a few friends and I decided to come here for their special. We had reservations upon coming and when we walked in we were immediately seated and greeted. Per usual, the two others that I came here with opted for the same specials that I also ordered because we all have very similar tastes.
Overall the meal was good, flavorful and tasty but we didn't leave completely full... especially since it was a 3-course meal. If I were to ever come back, I think I will need to give the pasta a try. Cheers!","Connie A.","Since it's Seattle Restaurant Week, I decided to try another new location, which this La Spiga is quite conveniently located in Capitol Hill. We made a reservation so we were seated quickly, and our server was attentive as well. I loved that we were seated towards the back of the restaurant where there was plenty of natural light coming from the windows, since I noticed they also had booths that were dark and reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory.
As our server took our order, I noticed a baby spider crawling on my menu, and he quickly took it outside to release it, which I appreciated! For appetizer, I ordered the truffle laced mushroom with a sunny side-up egg with arugula, which tasted fine, no ""wow"" factor, they served that along with pita bread that was brought to the table. As for entrée, my group and I all opted for the fresh fish of the day, which was a charred seared fish (that I cant recall!) but the texture was similar to that of a salmon filet. Portion size for the fish was surprisingly large, which was mostly tasty except for the skin - which was far too salty for my taste. Finally, for dessert, I got tiramisu, which was a bit sweet, but delicious nonetheless.
Throughout the meal, our server continued check in on us and our waters were refilled promptly as well. While I greatly enjoyed their service here, the food left something to be desired. Maybe I'll try their pastas next time!","Jordon T.","Unreal ownership! Staff! And food! Buy a little truffle butter to go and make sure to, if it's not to busy, to ask how to prepare it!!!!
Yum","Leah L.","Went here specifically because of a girl with celiac disease. This place has a ton of gluten free items in the menu and they market themselves as catering to people with gluten allergies. Loved that they have a large variety of gluten free pastas around 7pm. They then told her that they ran out of gluten free pasta. They said ""let me go see what options there are"". In the mean time, everyone else's food came out, there were 6 of us! The waitress walked by and we asked if they had any news and she said she forgot to ask and kept going to the back. One of our party got the last salmon fillet and she graciously gave her her dish. The celiac girl then asked the manager to make sure that the dish was actually gluten free. The manager went to the kitchen and disappeared for a while and came back to say that they were only 95% sure that the salmon was gluten free so it's up to you if you want to eat it. WhATT!!!??? This place advertises that they are a gluten free place! They recommended the salmon dish. Then they came back and said they ran out of salmon!!!! How does that happen!!??
By the time the manager came back to tell her that the dish was only 95% sure not gluten free, everyone was already halfway through their meals, and celiac girl was still sitting waiting. One in the party was very adamant about talking to the manager and when the manager finally came out, he wasn't very concerned about the situation. He offered to comp the pasta that the nice girl ordered as a replacement meal and offered to give the celiac girl a sorbet, which they knew was gluten free. But then the sorbet never came out! This wasn't the only gluten free restaurant on the street. The party could have chosen a multitude of other restaurants. It was a Monday night and they had an all night happy hour, which suggests that Monday's are slow nights. The manager really didn't seem believe the celiac girl, he seemed to think she was just choosing not to eat gluten. Absolutely terrible customer service
In terms of non-gluten free dishes, the pasta dishes were quite good and the tiramisu was delicious.
Unfortunately, the misalignment between marketing and reality was just too jarring for me to come back here.","Julie K.","I am absolutely flabbergasted right now. I just showed up to this restaurant for the first time. There are no less than 30 tables open but she asked if I had a reservation. I did not. So she literally seats me in the very back room in a corner by myself. You can see in the pictures. I'm all alone in this room. Then tells me I need to be done by 7:15 so they can take the table back. Honestly. I'm just floored. There is an entire deck off the restaurant with 15 tables and three people out there.
This is embarrassing. I'd rather her just say we can't accommodate you. Horrified."
"Pizzeria Credo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-credo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Gill M.","This place has it all! Amazing Atmosphere, Stellar Service, ‍‍Perfectly Prepared Food, Wonderful wine What more could you ask for? Wife & I had Meatballs & Caprese salad to start, Followed w/ Pesto Gnocchi & Carbonara.. All !!! This is where locals go, if you know.. Give ANY reastaraunt a run for their money!! Keep up the great work Credo!! We'll be back!
P.S.
Fernet Please","Madison L.","I've been wanting to try this place forever but they have such odd hours. Only open for dinner so it can be hard to find the time to come
They have the Guy Fieri symbol out front on their window so I was thinking ""this really must be the best pizza in West Seattle!""- and west seattle has a ton of pizza, but I think I had too high of expectations. I mean it was good, but was it the best? I don't think so.
We did a half mushroom half veggie pizza. It came out fairly quickly considering there was only one guy doing the pizzas. It's cool you can see him make them and use the fire oven and everything. It was like $18 which is a little steep for me considering we easily could have each gotten a pizza for ourselves but I understand.
They do have a house made oil that you can dip your pizza into and that's pretty good and original!","Alex O.","Cracked egg shells in the carbonara. Pasta felt like it came out of a box. Butter and eggs everywhere. Very little pancetta. Score: 2/5
1/2 calzone: dry and greasy. Filled with a lot of cheese, mozzarella, and sausage. Dough was nicely cooked. Score: 3/5
1/2 margarita: not bad. Would definitely get again. Score: 4/5","Nami N.","Came to Sunday night almost 8pm with my friend.
A man said ""we have only one Pizza dough.""
So we decided to eat a last pizza here.
We got a last pizza and asked veggies & meat one and a simple Caesar salad.
Caesar salad is just Caesar salad!
Pizza is little soft middle of pizza.
I wanted pizza to more crispy or well baked.
But taste was good.
A lady was a kind and nice service.
I want to coming back and try some more","Abigail E.","My family and I were absolutely blown away by our dinner at Pizzeria Credo. We each had to try a bite of one another's food because we were all raving about our own. Best spaghetti carbonara I've had, and it was so neat being able to watch the chefs make our food with the open design of the kitchen. It was also a treat having owner and head chef Jacques wait on us himself. It is so evident that he brings such heart and passion every day into his work. This restaurant is a real gem in West Seattle and I will be back, as well as recommending it to all I know.","Holly H.","Really good food! The half calzone pizza Alla Sasa was delicious. However, there should be a disclaimer that you only get 3 tiny meatballs in the appetizer that costs $11. That's my only complaint. The meatballs were great tasting just not enough!!","Linnea M.","4th review update, 12/26/19: Better than ever !
Do you think the perfect Italian dish exists? Well it does, here at Credo. I was a little apprehensive at the new menu but holy flying meatballs Jacques has knocked it out of the PARK!! Try the chicken sous vide, it is perfect. It comes with a small side salad and pasta on the same plate, which I questioned until I took a bite of the chicken and realized I wanted a salad too, which had been pre provided. It is absolutely perfectly balanced. The chicken melts in your mouthThis dish is pure culinary genius! No wonder Guy Fieri couldn't stop eating it!i told him to start charging more, because it rivals the best high end Italian (Scarpetta in Las Vegas) I've ever eaten and maybe even surpasses it. Next time this man opens a restaurant it will be in New York and $100+ a plate.
2nd review update: This place has been PACKED since Guy Fieri came here!! Finally getting the attention it deserves, I'm so proud to have this place right in my back yard! Jacques, the owner, is amazing and his drinks and drink recommendations cannot be beat. The cinqo fromaggio is a must try pizza, as well as the Biancoverde.
A tip for all ya lovers of Italian meats - prosciutto can be added to both options above to make an amazingly savory and delicious pizza. Hats off to the new pizza chef, I didn't think this place could get any better, but it has. Pasta dishes I'd recommend especially are the Gnocchi Vodka al a verde, and the linguine Alfredo á la Sophia. My favorite salad here is the Credo Salad - with a unique and refreshing mix of apple, feta and walnuts in amongst the greens it is a must try. My mother prefers the Spring Green Mix, but both are incredible!
Update: Alright, I have to update my review and if I could I would give this place another star yet.
Tonight I had no idea what I wanted to drink and asked for a cocktail recommendation- the waitress sent over Jacques, the owner. He asked what I was in the mood for (something semi sweet and sparkly) and came back with a newly invented cocktail. It was amazing and I had to keep the rest of my table from stealing it after they took a sip. This is the second time he's invented a cocktail on the spot for me and it's been AMAZING. And I'm picky with my drinks! P.S. they're still the best pizza in Seattle. Seriously.
Original review:
Still the best pizza in West Seattle! I've been coming here since it opened. Their drinks are amazing, and the owner told us he used to be a professional bartender after I complimented him on how good they were!
The blueberry mojhito is my favorite signature drink of theirs in season and the Credo cosmo is also delicious.
My favorites here for food are the gnocchi, bianoverde pizza with added prosciutto and the Credo Salad. Their salads are really unique and taste amazing.","John M.","Real Italian pizzas from a real Italian guy.
Everything here is good. Pasta, pizzas, wine, cocktails.
This is my favorite restaurant in West Seattle.
The salads and the half pizza half calzone are to die for.
This is where to eat when you are over at California junction.
The owner is a prince of a man.
A+++","Ayesha M.","This place is SO good. A simple pasta (the farfalle arrabiatta is what I ordered), no frills, just sauce, cheese and pasta, was delicious. That's the mark of a good Italian restaurant, in my opinion. If your basics aren't good, I'm not going to bother with the more complicated stuff. Anyway, I'm not sure if it was the manager of the restaurant, but our server pointed us to a man who helped us pair wine with our meal and the whole experience was just great. Highly recommend.","Joby J.","I have high standards when it comes to pizza. Raised in NY, and I've backpacked through Italy mainly to eat pizza. I've tried multiple pizzerias in Seattle, hands down pizzeria credo is my favorite. Tomato sauce is very good, dough is good, and their toppings are good as well. Wood fired. A must stop if you're in the area. Tip, get any pizza with their tomato sauce, I think that's where they stand out compared to others.","Cynthia T.","Super friendly local pizzeria. We came in with some friends from out of town, were running late and called to let them know, and they were able to push our reservation a little bit later with no trouble. Service was great, attentive but not overbearing which is always refreshing.
The pizzas were delicious, we got the Margherita ($13.95) and the Parma Con Uovo ($17.95). The pizza crust was perfect coming out of their oven and a pretty good size. The four of us were filled up after two slices of pizza and some pasta and splitting a rather large Caesar salad, which was also fantastic. Came out to be a very satisfying and relatively fair priced $60 dinner before tip. Will definitely come back and try some other pizzas!","ronny h.","Bomb pizza ! So worth the drive to SW Seattle ! Loved it !! I'm a pizza snob , and if you live real Italian pizza . It's here !
Grazie Mille per la pizza ! Molto Delicioso!","Shirene B.","On my latest trip to Seattle, I was pleased to see this restaurant was in walking distance from the Airbnb where I was staying. With my heart set on the chicken prepared via sous vide, I was told they were sold out. Of course with my luck, I was unable to make it back another night to try it.
But... It's a pizzeria right?? So with that my friend and I split the Caprese Salad, Carne con Uovo (egg on her side), as well the Spaghetti Carbonara. Everything was excellent. And although the pasta sauce is thickened with egg, it was the star of the night.
We were way too stuffed for dessert but they looked delicious on the menu. Credo stays on the bookmarks just in case I'm back in West Seattle.","Jim P.","Oh my, was looking for a place to get a late dinner and ended up here.
Cute little place on California. I'm real glad I decided to try it.
Not the largest menu but they do offer some pastas. But I came for the wood fired pizza and I wasn't disappointed.
I started with a ceasar salad that was pretty good..the only thing I would add to this would be anchovies, but that's just me.
I ordered the suggested ""meat style"" pie. Plenty of toppings but the star of the show was the crust. This is the crust I love, thinner, hold up well but still has a bit of crunch.
I will say that there was a peculiar flavor (I think from their sausage) that I couldn't really get my head around but it didn't take away from one of the best pizza's I've had since moving to WS. I believe it was the chorizo which in my opinion this pizza didn't need.
Bravo... I'd hit this place anytime.","Mollie V.","I ordered Pizza Credo via Door Dash recently. I was craving pasta. I ordered the gnocchi and it was AMAZING!! Salad was perfect, apple and vinaigrette...I am a fan and will be ordering again!","Christine A.","Nice location and decent pie. Very flavorful. I really appreciated that they were cooking right in front of us including placing the pie in the big brick oven fireplace. Service was excellent.","Robert N.","The food was very good and service excellent. I particularly liked the quotes all throughout the restaurant. I accidentally left my credit card behind and the owner was kind enough to mail it back to me. If you're in the area and in the mood for pizza, give this place a shot.","Lindsay G.","Poor service at the bar. The bar tender verbally said she knew nothing about drinks.
Our pasta was greatly undercooked and then the owner argued about that. Our meals were bland and lacked taste. Horrible service. Will never go again.","David C.","Not a bad spot to grab reasonable priced Italian food. Definitely not the fanciest place to grab Italian food in Seattle, but prob worth a visit. The place is somewhat a smaller space but we had no trouble getting a table right away on a Saturday night. The service was a little slow as it looked like one server was running up and down the restaurant. We ordered the Margherita pizza and the linguine Alfredo with a bottle of the house wine. I did realize we ordered basic dishes but they didn't blow me away. If you cook a simple and straightforward dish then it should be done well, or add a twist that is original. Not a bad meal for the price but would drive farther out to explore other options.","Anaya D.","If I can give more than 5 stars I would *****!! Omg the spaghetti carbonara is like no other, super delicious, I felt like crying from happiness! The creamy pesto gnocchi melts in your mouth and is heavenly. The Alla Sasa is freaking amazing (half Marguerita pizza and half calzone!!! I can't forget the pappardelle bolognese, which is another favorite!!
Thank you chef for the fabulous meals and welcoming atmosphere. These are all I've had so far and so far EVERYTHING has been incredible!!!
You can call ahead or walk in.
Enjoy (Mangia bene & Buon Apetito)!!"
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Mike N.","I've been here several times, over the past couple years. I have never been disappointed with the food. Tonight, we started with a chopped salad, and I had the rack of lamb with a side of meatballs.
While the establishment is smaller in size, the restaurant does not feel over crowded. Our server was very friendly and efficient.","Elisabeth P.","There is another Grazie in Bothell that we absolutely love, so we were really looking forward to trying another location. We stopped in here for dinner with friends and were excited to show them some of our favorite items on the menu but found out that they have slightly different menus actually. So we tried some new things instead of going for our usual favs.
This location is quite a bit smaller than the one in Bothell but is located in a great spot in between Seatac and the Tukwila mall, great place to grab a bite if you are waiting for someone to land. The beautiful iron center divides help to break up the one dining room and make it feel more intimate and the hanging stars from the ceiling and low lighting add a nice effect.
We were able to get a table quickly but had some issues ordering gluten free for me which was surprising because it was so easy at their other location. They did not offer the same gf items and the server wasn't really sure what was and wasn't gf as far as sauces were concerned, she just knew they had gf pasta. After some questioning I was able to order the mushroom spaghetti and the husband had the cannelloni.
We shared a caprese salad with our friends, which was a bit short on the basil but the mozzarella was nice. My pasta was just so so and our friends and the husband said the cannelloni they both ordered was okay but not super memorable. They didn't have the same gf dessert items as the Bothell location so we skipped dessert.
Overall, it was a pretty good place and I'm sure there might be other menu items that were even better than what we tried. Perhaps it was just our expectations coming from the great experiences at the Bothell location, but this one just didn't quite live up its sister location in service, gf availability, and overall taste.","Amandeep S.","This is the definition of a hidden gem: located in the corner of a strip mall next to Men's Warehouse, I would have never guessed for this to be such an amazing Italian restaurant!
My husband and I are nuts over Italian food and ever since we came back from our honeymoon in Italy, we've tried finding a place that gives us that authentic Italian taste - this place is the closest we have found!
We've been here 3-4 times now, and my latest visit last week really compelled me to finally leave a review. We've always had an amazing time here, each and every visit. This last visit, my husband and I took both our mothers for dinner, and let me also say that this place is always packed! But luckily we were able to get a table for 4 with a same day reservation (probably because it was a weekday), though it was still busy.
Our server was so nice and patient with both helping make suggestions on dishes and also giving us enough time to decide. I got the Ravioli Rosé and added grilled chicken - it was DELICIOUS! Highly highly recommend. It was perfectly balanced, not too salty and made the perfect dish to pair with a glass of red wine.
For dessert, we all shared the tiramisu - also delicious. To top it all off, after we had left, my mom forgot her purse and our server actually came running out after us with it! He was a really good server, I'm sad I forgot his name. Regardless, we will be back! This is our go-to for authentic Italian food :)","Alma B.","Absolutely lovely take on Italian cuisine.
Creative, interesting use of flavors and sauces. Somehow, they managed to make spinach taste like a beautiful dream. And lamb, oh ...wow. So tender, I could cut it with a fork. Usually, I don't care for taste of lamb, it was truly extraordinary.
The ambiance is very romantic and cozy, servers are simply gorgeous (is that like a job requirement?),
It is on a pricey side, luckily I had my trusty Passport Unlimited, it is what brought me here in the first place.
Coming back!!","Lexi N.","Grazie has continued to be one of my fav Italian restaurants! It's hidden away in a plaza area next to the mall but it's a gem. It's a very small and cozy restaurant with little seating but it's worth the wait. We ordered calamari and this cheese marinara dip thing (can't remember the name) but oh it's so good. Cheese and bread can't get better than that! They also give complimentary bread with olive oil. Something about their seasoned olive oil is sooo good. I opted for the pear Gorgonzola ravioli with chicken and it doesn't skimp on flavors! Flavors here ARE NOT LACKING so expect pungent and rich flavors! I love love Gorgonzola so it was an amazing dish for me. I'd have to say too much chicken compared to the amount of ravioli which isn't a bad thing! My family's dishes were also really great and extra flavorful.
Dishes are on the more pricey side but imo it's worth the higher price point. Service is great and desserts are beautiful.","Carla J.","I came in to Grazie with high expectations after hearing that their chefs train in Italy and good things from people I know. Because of this I suggested we try Grazie for dinner on Sunday night with out of town guests. Not all my expectations were met but overall a decent meal but with a little bit of a higher price tag than it deserved.
Service here was great. Everyone was super attentive, our water was refilled multiple times all without a prompt. Our appetizers and meals were quickly on our table so there's no issue with how they treat their guests.
The decor at Grazie felt a little off. For a place like this, I expected something a little more modern to go along with how they price their dishes but instead it felt like a chain Italian restaurant nearby. I also noticed a distinctly fishy smell in the air and I couldn't place where it was coming from, this above all was off-putting to me.
For appetizers we ordered caesar salad. The salads were well dressed and seasoned nicely but their dressing was super packed with garlic, to the point that our palettes were almost blown for the rest of the meal... and we love garlic. As for our entrees, nothing particularly remarkable about them. I had Pollo Al Limone, which was pretty much chicken piccata with artichokes. The odd thing about this dish is they serve it with their ""house pasta"" which is pasta with a tomato sauce. I've had a lot of chicken piccata (and dishes like it) and I have never seen someone pair that protein and sauce with something tomato based. It just seemed wrong to me. I wish they included more of a description of their house pasta on their menu because I would have asked for a substitution... or just plain pasta!
At the end of our meal, we got our checks and paid our bills. The server accidentally charged the wrong cards for the wrong bill. One of the amounts charge didn't even match a bill so we were not sure where that came from. We understood mistakes happen so we had no problem with him fixing the issue but he had to hunt down his manager to resolve the problem. I was uncomfortable with our credit cards being out for possession for as long as they were. The manager should have come to us and apologized but we never saw them.
Unless there's a happy hour special, I don't think I will be back. There was nothing remarkable that I tasted that I would crave to go back for. Their pricing is definitely higher than I think it should be, portion size is average. For example, $27 for their Pollo Limone is just too much.","Niki D.","Special dinner for our daughter as she departs for military service tomorrow- clean restaurant, attentive servers, terrific food! Shrimp perfectly done and delicate, everyone's pasta perfect!
Bread and dipping oil yummy!!","Myranda M.","So good! I've passed this place a billion times and can't believe it's taken me this long to try it out. The menu has a lot of variety and the prices are very reasonable. I ended up getting pasta carbonara and it was some of the best pizza I've ever had in my life. On top of everything they give you this pesto and olive oil that you put on the bread they serve. Out of this world good.
At the end of your meal, they show you the dessert display and every last item looked delicious. If I wasn't so full, I would have taken a slice of Tiramisu. In addition to everything, the customer service was excellent.
Will definitely be back soon to try more items.","Melissa C.","Everything was just average -- that includes service, decor, pasta, and bread. I had high expectations coming in to a place with more than 4 stars, but there really isn't anything memorable. Even the seafood was just mediocre and possibly frozen, and that was surprising since I'm visiting this town with lots of fresh seafood options. In fact, we even had no desire to finish the slightly overly peppered lump of starch (angel hair pasta) at the end. There's nothing wrong with this place though if all you want is a simple dish of pasta","Thao H.","Feels just like a home cook meal. The food flavor is definitely different from an Olive Garden. They have a good variety of options on their menu and they kept it to a one page menu, which is great. The service was good. Our server actually checked up on us. I would of gave them five stars, but the bread they gave us was very hard and they sticked use at an extremely small table that kept on rocking back and forth located close to the restroom.
Overall, it was an ok experience. It's a good Italian food alternative to the Olive Garden and this place has more of an intimate vibe to it.","Creighton R.","Glad I found this spot for dinner on Yelp while on a business trip in Tacoma. Not much around where I was staying. Since I was alone, I ate at the bar. The host escorted me over to the bar and the waitress showed up almost immediately. I asked for some
recommendations on food, which she was happy to oblige and suggested a few key items. Started off with a hunk of bread with olive oil and a red Zin that was just how I like it. Ordered the waitress' suggestions -- spinaci and the Linguini Del Mare. Spectacular choices! Wish I had not eaten the whole hunk of bread but when in Rome! Enjoy!","Marjorie H.","I wanted to like this place, I really did. But our experience went downhill once the server brought us our water.
First, the Chianti was mediocre at best. It had very little flavor, and the longer it sat and warmed, the harder I found it was to drink. It began to have an aftertaste that was unpleasant.
Next came the bread. Most Italian places we have been to serve warm, fresh bread. This was neither warm nor fresh. It wasn't even cut the whole way through, and we were not given a knife to finish the cuts. The bread was tough, and dry. The oil dipping mix was good, but it was lacking fresh ground pepper.
Our food was mediocre at best. I got Spaghetti and Meatballs, and the meatballs were uneatable, my husband got the Piatti (seafood and ravioli) - his seafood was over cooked and rubbery and his ravioli was under cooked. Plus the shrimp in his dish still had the tails on. Since the dish had pasta, the tails really should have had the removed. It makes for a very messy situation otherwise. The third member of our party got the Fettuccine Alfredo Chicken. The chicken came out mostly fatty pieces, and the fettuccine sauce had no flavor. Worst of all was the kids chicken meals. Pre-frozen Dinosaurs Chicken nuggets. Now, I understand how this might seem easier for the restaurant. But kids deserve to have food that comes without any additives. Every other Italian restaurant that we visit frequently offers freshly breaded chicken tenders.
Needless to say, when the server finally came back to offer dessert, we all passed and drove over to Panera Bread instead. We never got drinks refilled, and had to share our water with the kids in order to refill their drinks.","Scott L.","Chicken Alfredo was marginal. Sauce wasn't thick enough; flavor was not great. Puttanesca was good. Service was very good. Atmosphere was fine. Prices were too expensive for the quality of the food. Overall, I'd give it a 5/10. Not headed back soon.","Sally M.","Looking for a place that had gluten-free offerings and really tasty food, my coworker found Grazie on Yelp...4.5 stars, let's try it!
We showed up around 6PM and it was very busy, but we were fortunately able to get a table after waiting for 5 minutes. It's not too big of a restaurant, but they were very accommodating to all party sizes and moved tables around frequently to seat people.
I have to say, the food was delicious! I started with the spinaci salad, which was a decent portion size for just $6. The salad was pretty filling with the egg, pine nuts, and pancetta. For my entree, I ordered the large size of the tortellini gorgonzola and added chicken. Wow, this dish was so good! I only ate half and the leftovers tasted just as good the next day. I can see how this dish is so popular. The gorgonzola was just the right amount and I wasn't sure if the chicken I added would work well, but it was really tasty and gave me the extra protein I wanted.
Service was good as well. Even though it was so busy, our server took the time to answer our questions and provide recommendations.
It's located in a small strip mall near mattress stores with plenty of parking. You would never expect to find such great Italian food in this spot, but it is delicious. I'd definitely recommend checking out Grazie if you're in the area.","JJ G.","Bad STAY AWAY... over charged my credit card.
Came in twice this week and this is upscale casual where are you going to spend about $40-$60 per person. So they come and take my wine and meal order. Kid you not, 5 minutes later the glass of wine and my dinner is delivered. So I say my goodness. I want to enjoy the wine before dinner. The reply was well yes we've been in business for 31 years and our cooks are fast. Reason to logic, with sit down dinner service, they should not focus on pushing food out fast just to flip tables quicker. I get it--it's a small place but taking that few extra minutes to let the guests enjoy shows they care. They don't care at this place. My reply was, well this is upscale casual.... I ordered a Chianti which I like to consume prior to digesting my Meal in this relaxed atmosphere. So she said well...we can just remove your wine. Not even apologetic. They care not, Since they got a regular flow of guests coming in and making money and are be busy; these situations and bad service and concerns matter not. They said should we just take your glass of wine away we're busy enough attitude. So the wow factor is out the window here. Both my visits were the same. The first time I sat at the bar and the food came within like 10 minutes with the server saying like you need to order this... the most expensive item. Only because I waited to overlook the menu being there the first time I was probably asked for five times if I was ready to order it but I stayed drinking my glass of wine before I ordered. I should've done that the second visit. This is not fast food service. It's upscale casual people need to relax and unwind between courses. What got me, was the attitude we've been business for 31 years. Like that justifies miss treating people or dismissing their concerns.","J S.","Located in a very unassuming location near Southcenter Mall, this Italian Ristorante immerses you in the old country. A great pasta menu awaits, with plenty of fresh seafood options ... and of course steak and chicken for those who prefer. A robust Italian wine menu and homemade desserts to-die-for!! This is always a must-stop foot me when I visit Seattle.","Milton H.","Had lunch with a group of former colleagues on Friday. Fettuccine Puttanesca tasted good, if a bit salty. Portion was large, but that was only fair given the price, and that did not match the price on the web site menu. So-so service during the meal. Sat there for an hour talking and still no check until I reminded the waitress. This was not deserving of the 20% ""Automatic Gratuity."" Definitely won't recommend this place.","Kat W.","Was really disappointed based on the reviews. I had the Pollo Parmesan and to be honest it tasted freezer burned. I love this dish and order it whenever it's on a menu so was sad to not enjoy it. I did appreciate that it came with vegetables! My friend got the cannelloni and started chewing on a piece of plastic or tape after taking a bite. Bread and garlic/oil served before dinner was good (would've been great if bread was served warm rather than cold). Other friends had a seafood pasta and chicken pasta that they both liked. Perhaps we came on an off night. Bummer either way.","Bailey N.","Be prepared to spend money when you go here. Obviously it's a nice restaurant, so that's expected. The only reason I'm even writing this review is because when we ordered, the waitress asked if we wanted a salad WITH our food. She asked as if it was a side salad and considering that we were paying $20 for a small plate of mediocre pasta I assumed it would be included. Come to pay the bill and we were charged an extra $15 JUST FOR SALAD! Salad prices were no where on the menu either. We racked up a $70 bill for 2 small plates of pasta and 2 salads. Might as well go to Olive Garden","Julia R.","I was very impressed with this place. It was a special occasion for a birthday so I wouldn't come here all the time as the price is high but man what a treat. I love how they take the tray of deserts for you to choose from afterward. I would definitely recommend this place"
"Palermo-Ballard","https://www.yelp.com/biz/palermo-ballard-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","James T.","Had dinner for the first time here tonight and it was great. Our server greeted us and took our drink orders promptly, and our food arrived much faster than we had anticipated. The pizza was fantastic, I got the Palermo special and it was the perfect combination of topping flavors, rich cheese and perfectly cooked crust. The menu variety was a little shocking for such a small place, I was pleasantly surprised by how many options I could pick from. I will have to come back to try some of the specials that our server suggested, they all sounded delicious but tonight we were in the mood for pizza.
The only downside to our visit was something a few members of our party witnessed. We noticed a young woman eating in the back of house in full view of the restaurant. I'm not sure what her role was, for the most part she was simply standing around talking with other employees and eating from what I saw, but regardless it was pretty off-putting to see what appeared to be an employee eating in the back of house where guests could see her. It made me wonder what the standards for that sort of thing in Palermo's back of house were. Having worked in restaurants for a while I'm assuming that this was a one time mistake that doesn't happen frequently, as I know there are usually strict rules about not eating where guests can see you. I hope that the employee is talked to about the behavior!
Other than that one negative experience, I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.","Skyler J.","Fairly average Italian food with decent service and an inoffensive environment. I have visited Palermo several times and each time is fine, but no aspect is excellent. The food is hit or miss; I have had several dishes that were pretty good and well seasoned, but also several bland dishes. My friend has warned me against the pizza, so I have yet to try it.
The service is not great, not bad. I have had one very inattentive sever and several nice servers, but none of them seem particularly happy to serve you. They do have $3 a glass wine on Tuesdays and Thursdays (I believe those are the correct days) which is a plus.","Makayla D.","I love this place. They always treat my family wonderfully when we dine in. When we order delivery its always on time and wonderful. The most tender lamb, yummy pizzas, delicious seafood. Their sauces are so flavorful. Totally worth the price.","Nicole G.","I have no idea how this place has close to 5 stars. Absolutely disgusting food! The pesto chicken sandwich had hardly any pesto, the chicken was dry and over cooked. The spaghetti bolognese was a joke! NO flavor what so ever! The side salad that comes with the pasta is completely bare! Couple strips of lettuce a slice of tomato and slice of Cucumber. Ranch super watered down. Sandwhich and pasta was tossed out! Complete waste of money. Would not recommend and will not order again!","Floridaiz N.","Aggressively ordinary pizza with crust that's a little too thick and a little too soggy. Oddly, Seattle can't seem to come up with really good pizza places (and, in Ballard, forget it); Palermo is running with the mediocre pack. A cut above Papa John's but just barely.","Christin R.","Came here for lunch with a friend yesterday for the first time. I was pleased to see there was a nice lunch menu. We ordered the mini pizza which is I believe $8.50 and you can choose two toppings. We chose mushrooms and pepperoni (YUM!) It also comes with the soup of the day or salad. We also got the chicken fetuccine alfredo ($10.50) which also comes with your choice of the soup or salad. Since we were sharing, we ordered both a soup and a salad.
The soup of the day was chicken noodle. I was actually really impressed with the soup. I loved how thick the noddle was and the flavor of the broth was really good. The noodle was the perfect texture! The pizza was way smaller than we thought it would be, it was really yummy though. The fetuccine alfredo tasted pretty mediocre, no complaints. The two breadsticks it came with was really good.. nice crunch and yummy garlic flavor.
They have happy hour which is nice, I might come again during those times. They also serve breakfast all day! The food was good but I wasn't blown away.","Bailey G.","How can anyone like this pizza... I forget sometimes how bad it is and order it on a whim, because of the low delivery minimum and free delivery fee. But if you're looking for pizza delivery... try something else, if you want good tasting pizza. The only reason I give this place two stars is for the price and the quick delivery... so, this place has that much going for it.","Monica U.","Hands down this is the place to go if you're craving pasta! It literally tastes like a homemade cooked meal. My boyfriend and I came here twice while we were out visiting Seattle for the weekend, so that says a lot about how good this place is. The food is tasty, fresh and the service is great! Also you can't beat the affordable prices. Loved it and will be coming back again in the near future!!!","Paolo I.","Best pizza in Seattle.I eat there often and my favorite is Palermo's special.
Spaghetti Bolognese is another option for my frequent visits.
Good job guys!!!","Eric F.","Picked up some takeout from here for a relaxing home dinner on our recent Seattle trip.
The Classico meat pizza was very much American-style - thicker crust and tasty albeit crazy dense. It's not often I start feeling full after just one slice. This was quickly outshone by some creamy, derricious fettuccini carbonara. The pappardelle al pesto, however, was surprisingly overcooked and one-note in flavor.
On the upside, portions were gargantuan and we barely made it through half our of dishes.
Overall, a decent spot for Italian that leaned a little too far towards run-of-the-mill Italian American ""red sauce"" fare.","Bridgett W.","Bring your family over to this awesome Italian joint up in Ballard. It's casual and decent, providing you with plenty of food and a HUGE selection of food.
I got a Calzone and it was INCREDIBLE!!! I could only eat about half of it.
It wasn't too busy on a Monday night, and they had plenty of space for my whole party with no problem (we had 5 in our party).
Favorite thing about this place: I love the huge selection of items. It's almost overwhelming. And very reasonably priced. Everyone who ordered pasta said it was to die for, too.
Ambience/Location: The ambiance isn't anything super fancy or special, but they do have nice windows in the front to let lots of natural light in.","Pac Y.","I don't understand all these 5 stars reviews for this place. Pizza isn't great, pasta isn't great, service is all right but nothing to rave about. Very disappointed. There are a lot of better Italian restaurants the Seattle area.
The good thing is that there was no one inside at noon so we didn't have to wait... empty at noon, this could have been my red flag.","Ericka F.","Everything about pallermo is great. From the people to the food, the whole experience is always amazing. Whether you eat there take out or even delivery. I love the people and they make a great capaccino","Abhishek S.","VEGETARIANS BEWARE! Some things are marketed at vegetarian and upon asking more questions they are not! Just be careful and ask about what you're no sure of.","Miss T.","I have ordered delivery many times from here, including breakfast. They are always consistent with the quality of their food, and the prices are reasonable.
However, today, I decided to try something different and ordered the frittata/quiche. It
WAS not that at all! Lol instead it was an egg pizza (which I would NOT have ordered if it was properly labeled in the menu).
It was truly unfortunate, as that was my meal, and hopefully my friends' kid who will be coming over later will eat it.
It bothered me most because I hate wasting food AND money, however, honestly, it was a good laugh!!","Sabrina T.","I thought the Italian food was good!!! The service was great and I loved our waiter, she was such a sweetie.
I do think that the food was lacking in depth. My Caesar salad was drenched in dressing where I only ate about half of it... but their garlic bread and wine made up for it. We also called about 15 minutes prior and they happily reserved a table for us!!! Even though it wasn't busy, the gesture made us feel special.","Lulu L.","Is it gourmet? No. Is it delicious? Yes, always. They serve a delightful array of comfort food--always the best version of the offering--and their service is fantastic.
Particularly great if you have a large group wherein everyone has different palettes.
A longtime favorite.","Joe S.","Laid-back atmosphere with a friendly staff that will gladly give recommendations. I had the chicken parmesan pasta, which I absolutely recommend to any chicken parm fan. The garlic bread was also amazing.","Holly Y.","This is our go-to place for dining when husband and I can't decide on what to eat. Husband always gets the all day breakfast special (eggs, bacon, French toast). We prefer their French toast over their pancakes. And sometimes it comes with jam (really good jam that makes me think it's homemade). Sometimes we get jam sometimes we don't.... I've had a variety of dishes off both breakfast and dinner menus and everything I've had was delicious. The little scone that comes with some breakfast items is to die for! Recently I had their veggie pizza and it was the tastiest veggie pizza I've ever had! Don't forget to take the bill with you as it's a coupon for $2 off any breakfast item on your next visit! Score for husband as he only orders the breakfast special!","Fiona X.","Good pizza, great service.
We came here for lunch the other day and were starving, so we got a medium pizza AND the chicken wing appetizer to share.
The wings came out hot, juicy, and delicious.
The pizza was good as well, nothing to write home about but definitely good, and we ended up leaving with nearly half because we got absolutely stuffed.
The interior is very clean, and our server was very attentive and nice."
"Italian Family Pizza","https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-family-pizza-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tasnim K.","My friend and I ordered from here after I got off my flight from SFO. We had been planning on eating pizza that night for a while, but were stumped as to where we should go. At first, this place seemed an unlikely contender, as the options seemed really limited and we were unsure of how good the pizza would be. However, after much deliberating, we decided to go with Italian Family Pizza and we did not regret it!
We ordered a medium cheese pizza with bell pepper, mushroom, and garlic topping over the phone, and it was ready to pick up in 20 minutes. Soon as we walked in, they had our pizza out and ready, freshly made. The pizza tasted great -- the garlic steeped into the cheese well and the veggies used were freshly baked into the pizza. The crust was also surprisingly good, too. It was both amazing and filling for two hungry girls wanting to stay at home and watch movies! I'd highly recommend this place if you're ever around in the First Hill area in Seattle!","Tom E.","Delightful, slightly bizarre experience. If you're craving a gooey, spicy, crusty pizza, get the New Yorker. Genuine sausage, perfectly spicy cherry peppers, topped with gooey, creamy Ricotta, thin chewy toasty crust.
The gravelly-voiced server reminded me of a Doonesbury character, and the tableware was completely bright red plastic on an imitation-concrete table. Red cup, red plate, red napkin. I'm not kidding. As if that wasn't bizarre enough, to add to the ambience a sci-fi thriller movie was on in the background, replete with gutteral primordial noises.
But, there's no denying that pizza was incredibly good.","Ashley M.","This is the best pizza I've found so far in Seattle. The crust is very good, and their selection of pizzas is wide but not excessive. All of the varieties we tried had very fresh ingredients and wonderful flavor. Definitely recommend the margheritta!
Also, the crust is thin so don't be afraid to order a whole small for one person. 3 people can probably share a large if they're hungry
Definitely coming back for some more !","Mike O.","This was my favorite pizza place in Seattle when it was owned by the Calozzlis. I am from philly and this was the first really good pizza in Seattle. I was one his regular customers on First ave then it moved to first hill and then i was sold in 2018. Went back with some friends and it wasn't the same pizza. Crust was thin in middle but thicker in the middle and like french bread on the end. The sauce used to be wonderful and flavorful and now its just from the can. Its ok pizza but not worth driving across town and finding parking on first hill.","Marc S.","Great, no nonsense pizza joint with great, very reasonable prices and even better customer service!","Valerie R.","I would of given this place one star but they redeemed themselves with a discounted bill along with free dessert.
Thinking it was just really busy with both take out and in-service, we finally inquired about the status of our pizza after 30-40 minutes. Come to find out that our order was never processed! Really bad customer service as no one came over to check on us. And the pizza was okay but not worth the wait.","Brian B.","In my all-time top 3% of pizzas! That's nearly 40 years of pizza eating including a score of US territories, 3 foreign countries and 2 continents people!
The crust is so good I would literally eat it on its own as a plain baked flatbread. Soft, billowy, pulls apart like the gossamer feathers of angel wings! Flavors subtle and fresh. With toppings, the pizza has an excellent chew.
Tomato sauce is zesty and bright. Toppings are plentiful and perfectly balanced. They do add large lumps fresh ricotta to some of their pies. I'm not a huge fan usually but I loved it; you can break off the end crust and dip it in ricotta which was a fun way to devour a slice.
Pizzas are expensive but GIGANTIC. We plunked down $40 for the biggest pie and got stares all the way back to the hotel. It fed two adults and two young kids dinner and the next day's lunch.","Eli A.","Hands down, best pizza I have had! The large pizza is HUGE. Great customer service to boot. I come here every time I visit Seattle, and it is worth the 3 hour drive just for this place.","Yvonne D.","Wow! Where has this been all my life? Didnt realize how awesome this place is. Its close to New York style but not quite. The crust/dough is fluffy, filling, but light. They dont mess around with crazy toppings - everything is just right. The small is great for 2 people to share (we were going to order the large and the server recommended us from it - thanks for not upselling!) I will be back very soon!","Yoon Hee C.","I was having a hard time finding a good NY style pizza ever since leaving the Big Apple, but I think this place will help fill that void. Their pizza is ginormous without compromising the taste and it was one of the best thin crust pizza I've had in a long time (we had the New Yorker plus mushrooms, garlic, and tomatoes). The pizza crust is made from a moist, chewy but not too chewy, dough and they seem to use high quality cheese. Their ricotta cheese was silky and creamy (aka absolutely delicious). They ain't cheap! But will definitely come back for more. :)
p.s. Oh yes, the meatballs and lasagna. Don't forget to get those.","John N.","I am from the northeast (NY/NJ), and believe me when I say that it is darn near impossible to find great pizza elsewhere in the country (that nonsense in the Midwest doesn't qualify as ""pizza,"" though that's a separate discussion ). Italian Family Pizza comes close. I had the New Yorker 12"" (see pic). For the portion size, it was perfect. The sauce was notably fresh (not canned), the cheese to sauce ratio was spot on, and the dough was crispy on the bottom and soft but not soggy on top (i.e. not overdone). The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I felt the overall value wasn't 100% there. My bill was $20 (inc. tip). That's a bit steep for a single serving pizza. The large is $40! I get that it's Seattle, but you have to keep things in context. It's pizza, not truffles and caviar.","Peter C.","If I'm having pizza for lunch, my favorite way to do it is to have pizza and salad. Italian Family Pizza doesn't serve slices, but that just means you can go with a friend & split 2 things! The small pizza is plenty for 2 to share, and the salad is good. Definitely not a boring plate of greens. My friend very wisely asked for dressing on the side, and that was a pro move. The dressing is not your typical oil & vinegar. It's slightly spicy and I liked it, but in small amounts, which is why you definitely want it on the side, and drizzle it with a light hand. The pizza is good, and they definitely didn't skimp on the pepperoni (see pic). The only thing I may ask is for the pizza to be a little more well-done in the middle, because it's not sturdy enough to be picked up on its own. You have to support the center with a fork or something, so it's slightly hard to eat. But, a good lunch if you're in the area!","Sebastian T.","I love pizza, and after hearing that this places serves huge pizzas capable of feeding 3-4 people per pie, I had to see what the commotion was about. The interior is quite large, and it gave off a blend of vibes - authentic pizzeria & chain restaurant in the making. The server gave off a quick & snappy but warm feeling, but it made me feel like it was authentic experience.
The pies were exactly as i expected, they were huge, and I did notice that there was a pizza oven that got hot enough to replicate the semi-burned flavors you'd get on a pizza, but personally i'd recommend to avoid going with getting the HUGE pizza, get multiple smaller ones. The dough was a bit thicker (most probably due to the size of the pie), and the toppings/sauces were very scarce. I'm not one to desire heavily saucy pizzas, but there could definitely been more to give the right balance. I was almost tempted to ask for an extra serving of tomato sauce to pair with my pizza.
Even though the pie was slightly lacking, it was still average/above average, and the novelty of a huge pie can be great for big parties! I'd recommend coming here to try it at least once, I had a pleasant experience, and I'd come back to try their smaller pies!","Stuart F.","So let me start by saying that I placed my order through Yelp/GrubHub. When the order arrives the driver was carrying the pizza box in his hand, and not in a delivery bag--probably explains the Luke-warm pizza. When we got it to the room we found out that the pizza was made wrong (missing toppings). When i called the restaurant I got attitude from the kid that answere the phone letting me know that I had to take it up with GrubHub since they're the ones who placed and paid for the order. I said, ""but it's your restaurant and your name"". His response, ""so what are you getting at?""
I guess what I'm getting at is you own the customer experience, regardless of what crappy 3rd party delivery service you choose to represent your brand.
Pizza was okay, but would have been better with all the toppings we ordered, not just onions.","Kristin K.","This is definitely the best Seattle pizza! The large size is a literally HUGE, might not be able to fit it out the door. I have the clams on my pizza and they were so good!","Joe D.","Not great but not awful. Really can only say ehh. Crust was nice an crispy. The Grubhub driver sucked but that's not their fault.","Patrick S.","Absolutely Delicious! This is the Deal!
Italian Family Pizza is East coast style with thin crust, fresh ingredients, and incredible red sauce.
-The pizza:
After coming here a few times, there really is no way you can go wrong. Whether just ordering a small for 1 or 2 people, or ordering the very large 23"" pizza, any of the options will not disappoint you.
Their sauce and their crust really pair well with any of the vegetable or meat toppings. Personal favorite is the new yorker.
If you want to try something different, their white pie is sauceless, but comes with 3 different cheeses and you can always add toppings to it as well.
-Other menu items:
They have one salad, but it is all you need. It comes with a tangy red pepper dressing, and the salad comes fully loaded with olives, cheese, and pepperoncinis.
The cannolis are made every day and are too good to come from a pizza place.
They also offer pastas, stromboli, and calzones. I have yet to try any of these because the pizzas from this place keep me coming back.
-Service:
The customer service here is always friendly and your food comes out quickly. They will answer your questions if you have any, and are happy to make recommendations.
-Price:
For being in downtown Seattle, (well, first hill), these prices are really good. Especially if you go big and get the large pizza, you will get more than pizza to feed 4-5 people for between $30-$40 which is a great deal especially when you consider the quality!
Note: they do not deliver, but they do carry out, and there are third parties that can deliver if you so wish. However, it is worth going your first time, sitting down at the red-white checkered tables surrounded by brick for the full experience!
Cheers!","Ajay K.","Good price point for a small pizza but the sauce was lacking flavor. The owner/host was very friendly. It pains me to say this since it looks like a nice, family-run shop that has been around here for a while but I would have rather eaten at MOD which was a short walk away.","Annie T.","This pizza tastes like shit . Bed pizza place.bed pizza place . Shit pizza Bed pizza place Bed pizza place Bed pizza place","Alan D.","Wow, great NYC pizza in Seattle. This place is the real
deal and the 23"" pie is amazing but is huge and it will feed 4-5 adults easily. The crust was thin and crispy and done perfectly with a slight crunch and not burnt at all. Servers were bey friendly, efficient and a delight to talk to. This place is a must try for all NYC pizza lovers. You will not be disappointed."
"Orfeo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/orfeo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ashley P.","This is our second visit to Orfeo. In my opinion, this restaurant earned 5 stars. The cocktails are strong, took me the entire meal to finish 1 drink and I am Wisconsin born ;)
The first experience my hubby wasn't the biggest fan of the chicken, however he did enjoy the salmon dish i ordered, he dislikes fish in general. The flavor combos of the dish were done exquisitely.
This time we tried the pizza. This is our new pizza spot! The fungi pizza was heavenly. I salivate thinking of the burst of truffle oil flavor with every bite.
Finally, both visits the service was exceptional. Attentive but not intrusive.","Phuong H.","My boyfriend and I are from out of town and decided to come to Seattle for our thanksgiving weekend. Had Orfeo for dinner and it was the best thanks giving dinner yet!
We ordered:
AL FUNGHI- The size was definitely shareable between the two of us. The flavor was 100% there, everything was really fresh from the mushrooms to cheese, there wasn't too much of anything and it wasn't too greasy which was perfect.
LINGUINE ALLA PUTTANESCA- They knew we were sharing and split the portions in two for us which was great. There was a lot of shrimp even for us to be full even though we shared the pasta. Everything was flavorful but if you're not a fan of olives (like me) make sure to let them know.
CUSTOMER SERVICE- I forgot the names of the two men who helped us out but they both were really sweet, especially since it was thanks giving they made us feel the holiday spirit forsure. 10/10.","Maureen M.","Brasa was a fave of ours-- so it was time to check out the new restaurant in its place.
First the good:
The service was attentive .
The not-so-good:
The changed design. This space used to have the most beautiful designed interior and sensible flow. Now, long tables are inches away from the cozy half-moon booths-- poor design. My companion and I could barely hear each other.
The food was mixed.
We had to request bread-- why??
When it arrived it plain-- sans butter or olive oil.
The apps were good-- the polenta fritters quite tasty.
As were the oysters.
I order the burger & fries. The fries arrived cold.
The bun was mushy-- totally disintegrated into the burger--messy.
Why not a Macrina-- or similar-- roll??
The obligatory 20% service fee-- which is not listed on the menu.
No need to revisit Orfeo.","Paulina H.","(Highly recommended!!)Mediterranean mussels roasted over the coals and Spaghettini Al Carbonara
I came to this restaurant often, and I always order mussels for appetizer, however there are a couple mussels undercooked... tasted like the ocean.
Food: 8/10
Service: 10/10
Environment: 10/10","Mei Fu L.","I made an RSVP for 7pm on a Saturday. It wasn't too crowded, but still bustling as there were two other big parties near us. We were greeted by our waiter and we ordered three drinks: Eurydice, Hermes, and the midori drink. The drinks were pretty strong, but still tasted pretty good. The Hermes was our favorite of the three.
We then ordered the bolognese, carmen pizza, and orfeo salad to share. The salad was really fresh and the dressing tasted really good. The bolognese was pretty good. When the pizza came, they gave us a new york one. While we didn't touch it, our waiter came up and immediately took it away. We were a little confused, but then our carmen pizza came up right away. Between three, we were satisfied with the amount of food we ordered. The pasta and pizza were really hot and fresh and tasted really good. We ordered a tiramisu for dessert. The rum taste was pretty strong, but was still really good.
I would definitely recommend this place, as it was a little higher end, while also not being super expensive. I'm not sure if a reservation is necessary, as it seems they have a lot of space. I would love to come back to try their other pasta dishes.","Rosa K.","Came here with a girlfriend that was obsessed with mussels on the appetizer menu. She wanted to order an order each.
We ended up ordering 1 order of the mussels, an order of the grilled octopus salad and the Bolognese (I usually order Bolognese if the restaurant has it). Surprisingly, the Bolognese was my least favorite. The mussels were good but definitely, the grilled octopus salad were the best out of the 3 and surprised me the most. It came with castelvetrano olives, getable compose (bell peppers, garbonzo beans, etc) and a charred lemon dressing. It is a little more on the expensive side- we ended up paying about $90 for 2 apps, 1 entrée and 2 drinks- the bill did include an automatic 20% tip.
The interior was perfect for a date night- dimly lit and ambience was great. The pricing is just a little high for the food that we got.","Mary B.","After a long travel day from Florida, we we're ready for dinner at 4pm Pacific time. With seemingly endless choices of highly rated restaurants, we decided to walk to Orfeo and eat there if looked comfortable for two tired and hungry people.
Orfeo was simply perfect! They had just opened. We were the only customers-it was 4pm on a Wednesday! The happy hour price for a tequila grapefruit cocktail was $7, and it matched any$12 craft cocktail. We ordered 3 small plates. The hearth bread with various spreads was great. The bread was fresh out of the wood fired oven and the baked ricotta spread was our favorite.
We didn't catch our server's name, but the receipt noted Team One. Service was attentive.
While we were in the process of paying the check, the hostess or she may have been the manager brought us a complementary box of 4 very fancy doughnuts! Team One had heard us talking about finding ice cream or doughnuts. Turns out that there's a doughnut shop next door. It's owned by the same folks and was closing for the day, so they gifted us doughnuts. It was the perfect end to the day and a launched us into a happy vacation.
Highly recommend this place!","Mical T.","I came here because my cousin is having his rehearsal dinner here and it was a great choice. The service is EXCELLENT, the staff is very attentive and friendly. I got the NY Strip Steak a Sir was cooked to perfection. So glad we came here and I will be coming again.","Steve A.","We ate here twice during Seattle Restaurant Week and have since brought my Italian food loving brother and his wife back for a full menu visit. All meals have been remarkable. It is my favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle and that is saying a lot. I have always been a pastaholic, but Orfeo made me a flatbread fanatic!
You must start with the hearthbread appetizer with spreads and the polenta fritters, trust me.
For the pasta course I always get bolognese (really I order it pretty much anywhere that serves it) but I have tried most of the other pastas and all have been exemplary, esp. the Dungeness crab carbonara.
I've had For entrees I have ordered both the steak and the pork chop and loved them. My tastes of our table's fish and chicken dishes have been great as well.
Orfeo is not cheap but it is at the top of our list for a downtown date restaurant and for impressing out of town guests.","Andrew J.","Had a really great meal and experience. I'm a solo diner and was welcomed in, and sat at the bar. Turns out tonight there is all night happy hour at the bar. They also had live music and ballroom type dancing behind me. So a super chill atmosphere.
I started with a local ipa and the charbroiled oysters. The beer was bitter and fruity (my favorite combination) and the oysters were delicious!
I ordered the funghi pizza and it was smoky and super tasty. I may have to come back just for that.
The service was on point and the bartender made me feel very welcome. It's my second night in town and last night I had a poor experience as a solo diner....but not here.
The prices were cheaper than I would have expected for a place like this. The food was delicious and I appreciated the atmosphere and service. Fully recommend!","Alina H.","I came here for a birthday dinner as my friend reserved the large banquet table on the second floor. It was in their separate dining section so it's very private and good for big group dinners! I liked the ambience, you can chose to either dress up or down as I saw both.
My friends ordered the Hearth Bread. This flat bread comes out on a wooden platter with 4 spreads: baked ricotta, baba ghanoush, tapenade, and a whole roasted garlic. As soon as me and my bf saw that, we put in order for another hearth bread for ourselves. However, the server brought out their regular wheat bread. We were confused since we had asked for the hearth bread and really wanted it, but the waitress was able to take it away after the misunderstanding.
All the pasta is made in house, so everything tastes very fresh! I got the spaghetti al granchio ($26), which is just spaghetti with dungeness crab meat. Wished the portion size was just a bit bigger for the hefty price tag, but otherwise the dish was very flavorful. You get a good amount of crab meat as well. My bf got the mahi mahi which he enjoyed very much as well. The roasted potatoes were delicious.
Keep in mind there is a mandatory gratuity of 20% on the meal. Overall it was a nice experience with good service and I wouldn't mind coming here again for their pastas for a special occasion.","Heidi D.","My girlfriends and I were taught the tough lesson about making reservations on Saturday nights in Seattle. LOL We had planned on a different restaurant but when we got there, nothing was available for 2 hours. Whoops. Where to go next? Called a few places and the story was all the same. Finally... a place that could take us. :) We ended up at Orfeo and I'm certain it was meant to be!
Upscale casual, I found Orefeo to be visually appealing. I loved the flow of the very-open, multi-level restaurant...and though I know this isn't a technical term, it was beautifully curvaceous.
Service was well-paced and friendly. Food really hit the spot.
Polenta Fritters were crispy and went well with the marinara.
Orefeo salad - straightforward, fresh, not enough pistachios. :)
Carmen pizza - nice chew to the crust, tasty toppings.
One negative - no complimentary bread for the table. lol We arrived pretty hungry so that stood out to all 5 of us. (Yes, we could have ordered bread.)
Prices were on par for this type of restaurant, in Belltown, and I happily embraced Seattle's automatically added gratuity.","Elaine Y.","Food is phenomenal, but service left some to be desired.
We began our meal with the coal roasted mussels. Wow. Wow. Wow. This was easily one of the best mussel dishes I've ever had the pleasure of consuming! The dish comes with 16 mussels and 2 pieces of thick cut crusty bread. The mussels are so plump and they have this beautiful subtle smoky flavor from the coals that is also bolstered by the garlic, rosemary, lemony sauce. Unfortunately, we didn't have nearly enough bread to clean the dish.
Up next came our entrees which we opted to have family style and without alcohol. Maybe Orfeo isn't accustomed to this because this is where we felt service began to fall off and slow to a grinding halt at some points.
First, for a restaurant aiming for an upscale feel, I almost expect glasses/plates to be topped off/refreshed often, but they weren't. It really would have been nice to eat on something larger than 4"" plates and get refilled on our bottle of water. Plus when the table next to you who is actively drinking glass after glass of wine comments that service is slow....service must be slow.
But back to the food: The linguine with crab meat was very light on the palate. The crab meat was plentiful and the sweet corn and crunchy asparagus paired well with the silky soft freshly made linguine. Unfortunately the chorizo didn't add enough salt which is what this dish really needed to be truly amazing.
The pizza was our attempt to experience the hearth bread and I think it was fairly representative at least on the crust edges. The spicy meatball variety we tried was overall very good though. I liked the additions of onions and artichoke hearts to tie in with the meatballs. The crust is crisp but also has a delicious chewiness to it.
The lamb chops come with 4 fairly large bones. We opted for medium rare but found it to be a little too rare - still ate it though...still enjoyed it too. The balsamic reduction in the potatoes was delicious but the sauteed pea shoots were definitely on the older side and a little difficult to chew through. It was also odd we weren't given a serrated knife.
We finished our meal with the peach crostada topped with ice cream which was amazing! The crust was perfectly crumbly and the peaches were nice and sweet. French vanilla bean ice cream probably would have been more notable but regular vanilla still worked well.
The check took nearly an hour to arrive. We toyed with the idea of going to Columbia Tower after dinner (it was 8:20pm) but we didn't leave Orfeo until past 9. The poor table next to us didn't receive entrees until we were having dessert. Mind you, we entered shortly after them.
Like Steelhead Diner, Orfeo sticks a mandatory gratuity of 20% on the meal...if I was able to allot it, I'd hand every last penny to the cook. Kudos to the kitchen - 100 percent!","Thao H.","Came here for Seattle Restaurant Week and the food was okay. The service was a little lacking. They gave me a fork to eat with my affogato, which I thought was weird. Who scoops ice cream with a fork?","James S.","Went to this place for Valentine's Day and, though a bit corny with balloons and romantic looking decor here and there, it was a pretty good experience overall.
Service - Not great. Quite slow at times, particularly while waiting for our drinks which took 15 mins at least, but it was a busy holiday evening so not terrible all things considered.
Atmosphere - OK. Not much character and gives off a bit of a chain restaurant vibes to be honest.
Food - Good. Highly recommend the hearth bread, which is essentially cheesy bread with delicious dipping sauces (one of which is roasted garlic and is awesome), and the ravioli was solid.
Drinks - Very good actually. Highly recommend the Titan, which is well-balanced and quite booze-forward.","Ruth U.","A neighborhood gem. Fabulous food and service and loved everything we ordered. Had the mushroom pizza as a starter along with the wood fire cooked mussels and the antipasto board. Entrees were the Orfeo burger, swordfish and the pork chop. All cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. We will be back for sure.","Scott S.","The atmosphere was a bit abrasive when I initially walked in, but was welcomed when I sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice and friendly. I ordered the Narcissus cocktail to start, which was made well. I ordered the antipasto appetizer to go with it. The antipasto was a bit lackluster. Everything just tasted of olive oil and the cheese didn't seem high quality. I came here because I wanted some pasta carbonara. I was a bit disappointed in their rendition of the dish. It had chorizo and saffron, which turned it into a different type of dish for me. This is not your traditional carbonara. I think I'll plan on trying another Italian restaurant next time.","Julie P.","I've been to Orfeo twice, both for friends' birthday dinners and I've loved it! The overall experience was so good, I highly recommend it for big group dinners!
All of their pasta dishes were unique and delicious! We tried the Tagliatelle Bolognese and the Dungeness Crabmeat Spaghetti and both were so flavorful and superb! The portion size is good enough to share as well.
But my favorite dish of the night was the Charcoal Grilled Octopus Salad. The presentation of the dish was so beautifully crafted and every bite was to die for! I don't even like octopus that much but I would get this appetizer every time. The pizza was good but I prefer the other dishes over pizza.
The food, the service, & the atmosphere were all 5 stars. I will be eating at Orfeo often!
They also have happy hour everyday from 4-6pm!","Ross C.","Good food but they charge 20% ""service charge"" without letting clients know. Oh and it's 20% of the after tax amount. You don't tip after tax. When we came in we wondered why it was so dead and now we know why. Stay away. Never coming back here that's for sure.","J S.","DO YOU WANT TO PAY 20% MORE THAN YOUR FOOD AND BEVERAGE BILL IS? This restaurant tacks on 20% to your bill as a Service Charge!
Four of us went here for happy hour and our bill for food and drinks came to $84.00 plus $8.48 tax equaling $92.48, but then 20% was added to the bill along with sale tax on the 20% ($16.80 + tax $1.70) bringing our total bill to $110.98!!
So, we went from $92.48 to $110.98 because THIS RESTAURANT on its own tacked on a Service Charge and required tax. This is WRONG! We will never go back.
Fortunately for us, a friend noticed the Service Change because the receipt had ""Additional Tip"" printed on it with a line.
Be sure to ask BEFORE you order anything at any restaurant as I understand more and more restaurants may do this."
"Salvatore Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/salvatore-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Brianna V.","I absolutely love this place! We come here for special occasions and it never disappoints. Everything we've had here has been fantastic. We've had a dish that incorporates wild boar, gamberi ai funghi, gamberi alla deliziosa, a lasagna that had ground chicken and was one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten in my entire life, the squid ink pasta with scallops, beef medallions in a gorgonzola sauce, tiramisu, and the cheese and meat plate.
I also LOVE the wait staff. They are always incredibly professional.","Noah B.","Good restaurant with fair prices but there's quite a wait for your food. We waited 45 minutes

*Caesar salad","Mike P.","Best real Italian food in Seattle ..seafood always super fresh Ben coming here for yrs always the best","Trang T.","Definitely some of the best Italian food we have tried yet! The tagliolini cappesante (spelling?) was to die for! It was served with squid ink and scallops. As unappealing as it sounds, it was delicious!","S C.","Absolutely terrible service. The staff was loudly discussing issues and criticizing different customers at the counter where they exchange orders with the kitchen, in full sight and hearing of the customers. Very rude service, not accommodating in any way.
The food was ok. The ricotta was good but the rest was average.","Alex O.","Not good. Never coming back here again. Ordered the carbonara and it was awful. The pasta felt like ramen noodles in a cup. Soggy and over cooked and had a weird texture. Also it was just boring and bland. Even the tiny bits of pork didn't have a lot of taste. It was masked in this weird grainy sauce","Priscilla S.","I feel like fancier Italian restaurants could either be really good or really overpriced, and luckily, this place lands closer to the really good side. It's definitely pricey, but I think the quality of the food justifies the extra dollars.
I got the pasta carbonara, and it had fettuccine noodles instead of the regular spaghetti noodles, which I would have preferred. Topped with a copious amount of the Parmesan cheese they left at the table, it was pretty good. I think it's a bit creamier than I'm used to, but if you like that, then this place's carbonara might be your cup of tea.
Service was good, and food came out pretty quickly. The bread served tasted kind of stale, but I'm not sure if that's how the bread they use tastes or if it actually was stale.","Romer M.","Staff are nice, place is cozy and food is just simply DELICIOUS!!! I'll definitely come back for more.","Jessica G.","It wasn't very good, but that's just our opinion. Staff were nice, ambience kind of dingy, The bread was stale and the pasta extremely basic.
There are a lot better Italian places in Seattle for similar price.","Katie G.","Stale bread, tasteless and not-fresh pasta, and OK but underwhelming bolognese does not an excellent restaurant make. Any ""Italian"" restaurant worth its salt makes at least some of the pasta in house, and not last week. I specifically asked which pasta were freshly made in house, and the server said the linguine. As the bartender next door later said, ""meaning, soft vs. hard, as his answer, right?"" Me--exactly. ""That's what I've been hearing from people lately."" Nice atmosphere, though.","Charles B.","Excellent food and service. I've been there for dinner many times, they always exceed my expectations. Love this place!","Jack M.","Went on a Sunday night. Ordered the goat cheese+balsamic+beets, seafood risotto, some pastas. Tiramisu. Altogether the meal was delicious you wouldn't believe how cheap it's a real good deal.
I would go again. It was great for the price only reason I'm not putting 5 is the place is kind of rough. Needs some remodeling or something.","Kimi P.","The food here is good. The dishes are a good size and it was all very tasty.
I did have a weird experience with the waiter though. He sat all three of the groups in the restaurant in a corner by the window. After he gave each of the groups water, he got all of us to quiet down and started presenting the specials to all of us at the same time. They had just a ton of specials though so I could see why he didn't want to repeat himself.
Other than the specials announcement, it started to get a little warm with the sun coming in through the West facing window. If you're here in the summer, maybe ask for a seat away from the window.
Also, the coconut sorbet was served in a coconut shell. It seemed very similar to the specialty brand of ice cream sold in Costco and similar grocery stores. It was just kind of odd.
Still, the pasta was good!","Ross A.","Wow, this place is incredible! The bruschetta was delicious for the appetizer and we ordered amazing food from the menu. The service was perfect, and the portions perfectly sized. We even ordered dessert, which was also delicious. I can't wait to come back and try more things at this amazing restaurant!","Spencer M.","If you are looking for authentic and amazing Italian food, this is is must. The restaurant is small, but like most in Italy that you will find off the beaten track. It's best for couples and/or small adult dinner parties.
The food is amazing and you will not be disappointed.","Meg W.","The outside doesn't make this place look particularly inviting, but glad we finally made it in earlier this year. We've been pleased with everything we've tried; the burrata was especially noteworthy, and I've not had tiramisu the proper combo of boozy and earthy chocolate (rather than sickly sweet chocolate) outside of Italy proper.
A recurrent theme in the negative reviews for this place (and at least one other decent restaurant in the area) is about the bread. Here's the deal: Italian bread is not like American bread. It is there to absorb the incredible amount of sauce and good olive oil in your dish; the focus is not on the flavor of the bread itself. No, it's not modern artisanal bread. It's not trying to be, and it doesn't need to be. Don't dig it? Fine. But don't claim you want authentic and then bash it when it actually arrives!","Misun G.","The minute I walk into this restaurant, it takes me back to the amazing food I had in Italy. The smell, the wait staff, they all feel so genuine and gracious. My picky eater seven year old completely finishes his plain pasta with cheese butter, my daughter is more advantageous and she is willing to try some of mine and still eat her spaghetti. My husband and I check out today's special but we seem to fall back to our favorites . It all delicious and we can't wait to go back.","Jeff N.","Have I mentioned that my Italian side is almost impossible to please when it comes to Italian cuisine? But coming to Salvatore's was a nice change. I finally found a good Italian restaurant that makes solid Italian food that left me completely satisfied.
We ordered several appetizers including two antipasto, arugula salad and a special that was a mozzarella with mascarpone cheese and prosciutto.
The antipasto came with some cheese, salami, mortadella and capicola as well as some Giardiniera salad. I liked that they used hard salami and not the soft variety. The cheese was good but it could have used a few more slices. The capicola was nice and spicy as I like it. The gardenia salad had a mix of carrots, cauliflower, peperoncini peppers, celery and red bell peppers which was in the middle of the plate.
The mozzarella and mascarpone cheese appetizer was simply amazing. The mix of mozzarella to mascarpone was perfect. It was served with four large pieces of prosciutto and sitting on olive oil sprinkled with basil on top. Since there were seven of us we split the prosciutto in half so more people could enjoy it. This was my favorite appetizer by far. This went great with their bread.
The arugula salad had an olive oil and lemon flavor with some fresh cheese on top. It cane with several different types of tomatoes as well. There was a very large amount of salad which was good for our big party.
We ordered the ravioli alla Bolognese, the pasta al forno, spaghetti aglio olio & acciughe, penne ala puttanesca, penne Bolognese and two orders of the veal special. I had a taste of all of the dishes and really thought the ravioli alla Bolgnese, the veal special and the penne ala puttanesca were the best. I thought the penne Bolgnese and the pasta ala forno were both solid dishes but the spaghetti aglio olio & acciughe was way too salty and fishy. I could only eat one fork of it. But everything else was great so I'm still giving this place five stars. My little nephew ate the whole thing and loved it!
The ravioli alla Bolognese was great. The ravioli were cooked perfectly and none of my ravioli were broken. The cheese filling was not watery and there was just the right amount of sauce. It may not look like a lot of food but it was filling. The veal dinner special was served with a side of ziti. The veal was definitely the best thing on the menu! The flavors were balanced perfectly with the use of spices and a bit of wine. The cooked spinach with it also added to the overall appeal of this dish.
The pasta al forno was the lasagne. It was a nice sized serving and it was great to see that it was not watery when brought to the table. The balance of mozzarella and ricotta was spot on. Both the penne alla puttanesca and the pene Bolognese had al dente pasta. The puttanesca had a hint of anchovy in the read sauce. If you like anchovies get this. The one dish I did not like was the spaghetti aglio olio & acciughe. I had one taste of it and felt it was way too fishy with an anchovy overload! None of the adults liked it but my young nephew ate all of it.
For dessert we had the tiramisu which was huge! It tasted wonderful and was very fresh! The chocolate cake with ice cream had very moist cake and it was also a nice size piece of cake. The puff pastry dessert had a nice amount of whipped cream and ice cream. It was very filling!
We also had two bottles of Arcangelo Salice Salentino which was good as was the Peroni of course. We also had espresso and black coffee.
Everything except for one dish was great. My Italian side left very satisfied! If you give this place a try tell them Jeff's Nonna sent you!","Steven G.","Amazing, amazing Italian cuisine. Felt as though I was back in the Old Country and not in dreary Seattle. Excellent wine selection.","J J.","I am in love with this place! Everything I've ever ordered was fantastic! I especially love the sautéed mushrooms and chicken Gorgonzola.
It is a small place, but the food makes up for that. If you want authentic Italian food, go here! Yummm!!!"
"IL Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-bistro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Irika S.","Boyfriend and I came here for my birthday after our previous reservation didn't pan out for an odd reason. Regardless, definitely not disappointed. The food was both plentiful and good, and the waitstaff were very nice about helping us pair wine with our food.
However, just be aware that the lighting is quite dim and this is not a quiet place! Most of the time we couldn't hear the background music and had to elevate our voices a little to talk. It didn't bother me so it won't really affect my rating but it may be an issue for others.","Nhoj K.","We spend a week end in Seattle at Christmas. A highlight is a dinner at a nice restaraunt that has some character to it. Our favorite place recently closed leaving us in need for a new Saturday night dinner place. Through Yelp, we decided upon il Bistro. Great find, but.....
This is a wonderful setting, at the foot of Post Alley and the Gum Wall and in a classic basement bistro setting. The ambiance was super and just what we like.
The wait staff was friendly and prompt. However the kitchen and bar seemed ""behind"" and so our drinks and meal took a long time (more than casual, elegant dining speed).
I had the gnocchi, my daughter the ciappino. Both very good. In fact, my daughter tried a bite of the gnocchi and said it was the best she ever had!
My wife on the other hand, had the chicken dish and was very unhappey with the chicken itself. The sauce and fagioli were very good but the chicken tastless and ""an odd texture"". It was not on the level of the rest of the dish or our dishes.
We will likely give il Bistro another try as we like the restaraunt, but not for the chicken dish.","Don M.","When I'm on vacation I like to find ""famous stuff"": the lounges that the stars used to hang out in - or those places that all the locals rave about. My wife and I were thinking Il Bistro might fit the bill. It's been there for 30 years and It's located just off Post Alley. In fact the back wall is the legendary ""gum wall."" So we were expecting something amazing, maybe even legendary. The Yelp reviews promising an ""underground gem"" really fuelled our expectations too.
Based on the meal we had, I'd have to give it a rating of ""meh."" Certainly not worth $105 - which, with tip converts to $165 Canadian. I expect a memorable, or at least a good meal for that much.
The place was packed, and if you're looking for a quiet rendezvous you might be disappointed - especially if you want to whisper sweet nothings into someone's ear. While it's dimly lit (i.e. you can't read the menu without the decorative candle), cozy (low ceilings) It's louder than a Jr. High classroom the day before the school dance. We actually moved tables trying to escape the frat-party din.
Of course, all of this is minor if the food is actually good. We certainly didn't find anything to rave, or praise even faintly. I had the risotto, which was a cafeteria-style rendering of the dish. The predominant flavour was ""too salty."" Besides cheese and lots of salt, there was no real discernible seasoning, nuanced, layered or otherwise. My wife had linguini al mare - and the title was obviously taken too literally. It was swimming in a seafood ""broth"" best characterized, once again, as salty. I couldn't really taste anything else in the dish to even conjure a guess as to where the chef was going form. While I'm a big fan of ""letting the ingredients speak,"" in this dish they just kind of whisper, or gurgle.
We began our meal with unremarkable starters. A Tuscan bean soup - which, again, mostly just tasted like salt with a definite grocery-store deli vibe. My wife had a watery Caesar salad which, for the first time in our experience, had no garlic in it.
Between us we ate less than half the food. Surprisingly, maybe because they were busy, or perhaps because they're self-satisfied/arrogant, nobody asked, at any point, if we were enjoying our meal. Of course, I don't really think they cared, the service was brusque, cold and indifferent. Maybe we're too Canadian we expect nice.
In hindsight, I guess every city has those bland, over-priced, old school grad-dinner-and-anniversary Italian joints that people's grandparents really seem to love. This place definitely falls under this category.","Joy S.","IL Bistro is a slightly hidden, tucked away ""underground"" restaurant. It's super easy to miss because it's sandwiched in between the Gum Wall and a graffiti/""art"" plastered wall, both of which are so easy to divert your attention to. Even though it's in the heart of all the tourist traps, it feels like a mostly-locals hangout. In fact, we wouldn't have even found this place if not for a local - and we walked right past it the day before and had no idea we passed by it.
The ambiance here is super romantic - everything is dark and candlelit making it a great date night spot! It was pretty packed but they were able to seat us ""in the bar area"" (not actually at the bar, but a tinier table right by the bar) right away on a Saturday around 8 pm.
We just came for drinks and snacks since we ate earlier. Their drinks + cocktails list was pages and pages but luckily our server was super helpful in choosing drinks to our liking based on our alcohol preferences. Service was great - our server had a great vibe, checked up on us just the right amount, and did her best to personalize everything we ordered so it was just the way we liked it!
We had their Antipasto Misto (selection of salami, imported cheese, marinated vegetables) - aka a meat & cheese plate. On its own it's $16, but we substituted for burrata and added bread so I'm not sure what the total came out to.
It was a really good variety, with about 3-4 cured meats and a bunch of pickled veggies like cauliflower, carrots, olives, cucumbers, bell peppers. I just wish there was more cheese than just the burrata.
Overall IL Bistro was a super cool find and a great way to feel transported elsewhere - sitting here, you totally forget you're in Downtown Seattle!","Mary T.","Top 5 happy hours spots in Seattle if you ask me! Their happy menu has great variety and portions. Some of personal favorites are....
-rigatoni
-caeser salad
-pizza
-bruschetta
-mac n cheese
A pike place hidden gem. And their beverages always hit the mark! Love the ambiance and music as well(:","Mizuki R.","This is one of my favorite restaurants, the food is amazing, and the waiters/waitresses are absolutely amazing. They are always on top of the menu and what tiny details there are to the food that are helpful when making the decision.
The bar is also amazing and so far the wine and cocktail selection has been delicious!
The atmosphere is also romantic and always puts me in a great mood.
Definitely recommend this place if you are on the fence about going here!","Dusty M.","I've been coming here for years! I don't know A single tender, waitress/ waiter, greeter that works in this fine establishment!
Yet everytime I come in for the late night menu I can't help but feel like the staff already knows what I'm there for. To reserved to ask names, at the same time I feel like I already know them. And they already know me! I take comfort In seeing the same faces that have been there for a length time. ( staff ) and I've yet to be dissatisfied with the service provided.
I can say without a doubt this is one of my top five in Seattle from the gut of the market. From Seattle over all! If you are a tourist, do not rob yourself of good meal and strong drink at a more than fare price.
If this could only be the standard......
Thank you Il bistro, stay classy.","Sareen K.","I was roaming around Pike Place to get me some food before going to my work event. So I saw this cute little Italian place that looked so good, and they mentioned they have a special for smoked salmon. So I said I'll order it, but wow, just wow. I had never in my life tasted something as horrible as that. I will never eat here again in my life. I gave some to my coworker cause he loves smoked salmon and he's not picky at all, and even he thought it was horrible. On top of that the dish cost over 40 bucks. I would never recommend this dish to anyone.","Julia L.","This restaurant is a great setting for intimate dinners. The inside is dimly lit with tablecloths covered seatings and wood accents. I recommend trying the calamari (great vibrant flavors, not the fried type), the rigatoni bolognese (hearty, savory, rich flavors), and the cioppino (filled with fresh seafood and fresh tastes). I've dined here several times, the food and service quality both have been very consistent.","Upasna D.","Hubby bought a romantic package for my birthday dinner. The table was decorated with flowers when we arrived which brought a smile on my face. We ordered bruschetta crostini for appetizer and two vegetarian pastas for entrees . Food was average, service and ambience outstanding.","Victoria Helen L.","It ain't what it used to be!
While service and ambiance at il bistro are always wonderful, the food has gone dramatically downhill in the last year or so. On our most recent visit, the pizza came out cold, the pasta was undercooked and the Caesar salad tasted oddly like pickles. Very strange. The visit prior featured burnt pizza and unsalted prawns... it's a smorgasbord of culinary disasters.
Despite that we will probably be back because they're open late, staff is helpful, the bartenders are friendly and the prices are low. If the food was consistent it would be a more regular spot... fingers crossed it picks back up. We will keep the faith until then!","Pepper M.","The flight from Louisiana was miserable, with crying babies and turbulence, and we walked and walked to and from the light rail, dragging our three suitcases behind. I was hungry and tired. We walked in to this restaurant out of a cold winter rain with low spirits. We were welcomed heartily by the bartender. Our server Sofia was knowledgeable and fun and explained the history of the amaro. The drinks warmed me up, and the small plates on the happy hour menu were satisfying. An unexpected, cozy welcome to Seattle.","Michelle M.","I spent a ridiculous amount of time online reading reviews of restaurants in the city to go to for our anniversary, and nothing was jumping out at me. Cookie cutter everything. I wasn't seeing anything truly special and about threw in the towel and chose one of the usual suspects. Then, I found something about IL Bistro. The name wasn't familiar, so I looked into it a bit more. Little did I know that this was the place I'd walked past for years and years, always curious about the tucked away spot below the market entering post alley. Immediately upon seeing the photos alone, I felt butterflies in my stomach....this was most definitely the place. I booked a reservation immediately. The evening of our dinner, we took a nice stroll through the then closed and quiet Pike Place Market and he was sooo curious about where I had chosen because I kept it a secret. lol We began walking down into post alley and made the first left into this beautiful hideaway. We were immediately greeted by two very polite and funny gentlemen and lead to our table. I'd arranged for their romance package, so as we got closer he was surprised with rose petals and champagne waiting for us. Our server was amazing! Great conversation and not at all intrusive. Literally any question we had about an item on the menu, whether it be food or wine, she was able to answer in great detail. I ordered the Linguini di Maré (linguini with mussels, clams, calamari, white prawns, market fish, in a white wine herb broth), and it was wonderful. Every flavor stood out, none competing with the other. The broth was very light and the entire dish perfectly balanced. He ordered the Agnello al Forno (roasted lamb sirloin, rosemary polenta, ratatouille vegetables, caselvetrano olives) and devoured every last bite....before making his way to my dish. lolol
The mood in the restaurant is very intimate and cozy. There are candles everywhere creating the perfect romantic evening out with your partner, date night-anniversary-or just because.
Thank you again, IL Bistro crew! We had the perfect evening and cannot wait to return.","Katie W.","Cute little place right in the heart of Seattle. I went here with the singer of Korpiklaani and a fellow fan. We ended up sharing a pizza and beers together. The pizza ended up being on the house because there was a bit of delay but we barely noticed because we were deep in conversation. Pretty crowded place for a Tuesday night but I can definitely see why. Good quality food and drinks and I would definitely return sometime in the future.","Sarah J.","I love this restaurant!
I'll Bistro is a wonderful Italian restaurant with an intimate homey atmosphere and great food.
I've been here several times and have never had a bad experience. It's right by Pike Place so I thought the prices would be high, but was surprised by the very reasonable prices (mid to low $20s for entrees, high teens for pasta dishes).","Amy J.","Always friendly fabulous service and overall lovely experience when eating here. Food is spot on, especially the special entrees. Will continue to enjoy this as one of our neighborhood favorites.","Tim M.","We went there last night for a company dinner. The food and atmosphere was amazing, and the service was great. Highly recommend this place","Taylor S.","The food is solid but the cocktails are world class. IL Bistro is in my Top 5 places in Seattle to go for a drink and grab a bite to eat. I just tell the bartender what I typically like and ask to have something created. Last night I said Mezcal, citrus forward and not too sweet. The result is seen in the photo. It was fabulous. The Late Night Food Menu make this place a great pick after a concert. The bar is open until 2 but I think food is only available until midnight. Happy Hour specials are also great. Folks in the service industry come here after work and I love that about the place. Nothing against tourists (I mean this sincerely) but it's nice to have places that cater more to locals.","Raymond T.","This place is the most underrated bar in the area. Cursed as an industry bar because of its dark and hidden location Il Bistro is filled with a lineup of the best bartenders I know in Seattle. This is my favorite stop for a prefunk, dinner, happy hour, etc.
The Venue is dark and equipped for live music. Beautiful red roses salute the bar as beautiful orange lanterns illuminate the detail in the bartenders craft. Dan the man is my favorite. Bar manager, relatable genius, daring mixologist, and a class act. I come with a different request every day and his drinks not only satisfy but inspire.
The happy hour pizza is great, pastas are delish, but honestly I only come for drinks and ill make a trip just to see Dan. If you're trying to meet people in Seattle and have an intimate adventure with a bartender, this is my recommendation.","Lyn S.","Best flourless chocolate torte I have ever had! Just the right balance of sweet and chocolate with mascarpone dollop and toasted hazelnuts in the drizzle! Service was more than excellent."
"The Zouave Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-zouave-restaurant-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mike V.","Hail to the chef. Why are these restaurants only in Seattle?
It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
honestly, just order whatever you want. some of the best gnocchi with lamb we can remember, but the osso buco. This was the best I have had since Francesco's off Hegenberger in Oakland that closed in 2016 after 47 years.","Megan R.","I would give them 3 1/2 stars if I could but they were A-OK!
We came here one night and were seated on the back patio right away.
The service was super friendly. A couple people touched our table throughout the night to make sure all was well. That is always appreciated.
The food was OK. We got a lamb rack with gnocchi and salmon pasta. The gnocchi was really chewy and just inedible but the lamb was very tasty! The salmon pasta really wasn't anything to rave about. Nothing stuck out about it, pretty basic.
Overall, the outside seating was nice, the service was friendly and the food was ok! Nothing to complain about it and it was a nice experience.
They did give complimentary tiramisu at the end and that was nice.","Laurel P.","I just wanted to update in case the restaurant owners look at this - - I really like this restaurant, but I have to agree with some others that the ambience could be a nicer... Maybe less harsh lighting, candles? I can't recall if there was music. I mention this because I was thinking of this place for Valentine's day dinner, but I decided against it only because of the not-very-romantic ambience. If that's not what you need with dinner, though, then I recommend this restaurant!","Maxwell R.","Had a date night and was craving Italian. The decor was bland, but was hoping the food would make up for it. Ordered the chicken marsala and ravioli. The chicken was not fresh, was bland, and had the consistency of rubber. The ravioli was okay, but lacked any flavor. Overall disappointed.","Carol J.","We had a great time at Zouave's restaurant a couple weeks ago. The food was DELICIOUS and plentiful. We had a great conversation with the chef, and the server was also great. They seemed very knowledgable about the dishes and the wines of Italy as well as cuisine from other parts of the Mediterranean.
I highly recommend this intimate little restaurant if your looking for a special experience!","Andy S.","We came in wanting to like this place and left feeling just... sad.
The food is awful. Like reheated chain restaurant quality. Your wine choices are clearly so bad they won't provide the brand label on the menu. The decor I would describe as Italian themed man-cave.
I'm writing this review to maybe help correct, as other reviews have noted, what seems like a high level of fake positive reviews for this restaurant.
I hope the owner can improve this place, maybe limiting the menu options would help.","Maren H.","I walked in to the cute restaurant and went for a sweet spot in the back porch on a warm day. My husband and I were excited by this charming little spot. Cute, cozy with a great neighborhood feel. We ordered wine, both of us thought was Meh... Their house was not our taste (me White, He red)
Then the food came. We got the antipasto plate that was lacking variety. Then I had Gnocci and he had the Chicken Marsala. Both were bland, the chicken was not moist and kind of rubbery. The Gnocci was chewy too. The service was slow.
Sad to say, I wanted to like this cute little spot but we won't be back.","Marina L.","Hidden Italian gourmet! Nice patio and great food. Met the chef and he was very friendly with suggestions on the food. The mushroom soup was really good! My dish the chicken prosciutto was a bit saltier than I like, but was still delicious!","Vanessa M.","We decided to come here because of the reviews on Yelp. It was a bit empty when we walked in so we decided to sit out in the patio. We stared at the menu for quite some time as we didn't know what any of the dishes looked like (I'm a visual-kind-of-person). After Googling some dishes and speaking with our server, she suggested the Lamb Ragout Penne Pasta (minus the lamb ragout-vegetarian option) and the Gnocchi. We waited almost an hour for our food, which we weren't too upset about because the chef's wife mentioned that the bread and pasta sauces are all made from scratch. Let me just tell you, THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT. The food came out really hot, but it was delicious! I don't typically like gnocchi, but this gnocchi had a perfect potato ratio. And the penne pasta I had was surprisingly very good. At the end of our meal we were offered a slice of tiramisu, on the house (the chef also made from scratch) for having to wait so long. Tiramisu isn't my first choice when it comes to Italian desserts, but the texture was soft and sweet enough.
Overall, I definitely recommend it! The people were super friendly and the food is delicious.","Zellie M.","This is such a hidden gem. It's little house-looking restaurant on 65th. My babe friend and I have been here a few times and whenever we're feeling fancy, we go here. We LOVE the lamb shank with the gnocchi. Always a yes when we come and thankfully it's a special every time we're there. Tonight we also had the ribeye special (11-12oz!!!!!!) with ravioli, which was cooked amazingly and was chewy and tender!!! The food portions made us so sleepy because it was just so much food :-)
I love the service as well. Typically there's a server and a waitress but it was just the chef when we were there tonight, and he is always so kind! Amazing chef and owner 100%. We were also given free dessert. Ahh, please support!! It's totally worth the money.","Aimee D.","This place was incredible. It is our second time going there. The chef is not only talented but so delightful to talk with. The menu is a reflection of his talents. The food was so tastefully prepared and had a distinctly delightful depth of flavor. The four of each ordered something different and each dish was so good. We ordered cannoli's and they were as good as any of us East Coaster's have ever had. He gave us a sample of his Tiramisu and it was wonderful. Will definitely go back time and again.","Steve F.","Our large party was treated so well here. The chef/owner kept checking in to make sure everything was to our liking. He need not have worried, because we had a great time here. Their large outdoor seating area (with plenty of shade) was perfect, as was their menu and its execution. I had a yummy smoked salmon with penne pasta. Everyone else loved their choices as well. The owner even included a couple of plates of tiramisu on the house for us to share. So nice of him. I'd love to come back here when in the neighborhood again.","Regina R.","Excellent paella and Cioppino!! Wow!!
Fresh seafood-all home made
And the chef and wait staff personable and efficient and really nice.
The Tiramisu was to die for and made by the chef owner-- come just for that and you will love it!","El T.","Either the reviews here are questionable or Seattle-ites don't have a palate but this really wasn't good. Ordered the paella and seafood wasn't fresh, the dish smelled fishy before I went in for my first bite.","Bobby R.","Ordered ""Penne with vegetables and marinara.""
Pasta was overcooked and soggy. The sauce as watery and insipid.
Not sure why exactly there were green onions in my dish.
Was actually really nice to dine outside 'though, and the sangria was very tasty! Too bad, the food really stunk.","Patty S.","Absolutely fantastic. New baby at home, birthday...no way we could go out for dinner. Zouave saved us.
Meals were fantastic. I had lamb with gnocchi. One of the best lamb meals i have had. Everyone loved their dinners. Flavors were great. Seasoning was spot on.
Cannot say enough about the staff. I think it was Jason who took my call. Order was perfect. They even threw in a bit extra. I will be going back next time i am down here visiting my daughter.
Thank you so much!","Brett S.","The best meal I've had in Seattle and I've done the hot spots. Not only is the food great, but the owners are a family and make you feel like you're coming to a friends house for dinner.
Can't wait to visit again","Tian G.","This is a little gem. Their food is full of flavours, and are very uniquely designed - definitely some authentic Italian pastas and entrées. I tried the lobster ravioli with shrimp. The sauce was great! One of the best I have ever tasted. However the lobster ravioli was not very fresh and as someone who is sensitive to the fresh taste of seafood I can tell that it has been keep for a while. The portion was decent, but may not be enough for big appetite. My friends ordered the lamb shank, which was well cooked, soft and soaked in flavoues. The shank has lots of meat. We also ordered their seafood fried rice, which is equally awesome. Their seafood pasta is good, though not spenlendid.
We can see their cheif cooking. It seems there is just one/two people preparing and cooking the food so it takes a while to get our food. They gave free bread as appetizers. We also ordered their tiramisu which I am not a fan of. Overall a solid restaurant.","Haena K.","The chef and the staff were really nice, and it's a cute place. If you want to eat a home-made meal that you could make (if you had the time, and you are not the best cook)then this is it.
If you are looking for really good eats or you are a foodie, this is not it.
So although I wanted to like this place, since it's a local restaurant with kind staff, I won't be going back.
I feel awful writing such a negative review, but I think it's deceptive for other yelp users to see 4.5. Mioposto got 4 stars when its amazing! There's something really fish going on here! I'm wondering if there are made up reviews on this!!!","Omkar W.","I absolutely love this place. Definitely come in the evening and dine outside. I brought two friends, and two of us got the ravioli and the other got the sicilian tortellini. Also, try their soup of the day if you have room. Their service was amazing, and our waiter had the most beautiful, golden voice you can imagine. I'm talking about that deep, sonorous, mellifluous TV talk show host type voice. 10/10 baby."
"Pie Bar","https://www.yelp.com/adredir?ad_business_id=dxFKEFMHQM2a1XtlmnaWiA&campaign_id=47_iNiF8SpTKkxmQQbG25Q&click_origin=search_results&placement=below_search&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fpie-bar-seattle-2&request_id=ee30f07536df9067&signature=a66b1bd31f5753d027ecb50c60688c04ec7acaecee4cee46c51778530e6d0037&slot=0","Katie M.","Super super delicious pie! Contrary to what it says to on Yelp, the inside bar is only open till 1 but the window for to-go is open till 2.
Went around 1 last night, and unfortunately it was closed inside but we were able to take a few pieces to go.
They were out of the apple crumble so I got the deserted island and it was warm and soooo delicious! The guy at the front counter was awesome and even gave us extra ice cream to make up for no apple crumble.
Super impressed and will definitely come back! My friends got the savory pies so I'm trying that next.","Amiee L.","If you like pie & great drinks then you have died and gone to pie heaven!
First, there is a window that accessible from the street to buy from so you don't have to go inside. The bar itself is TINY and sits about 25 (and that's if you want to get cozy with the people around you).
If you are lucky enough to get a seat at the bar then you will get a chance to be in pie heaven with drinks!
Everything is good. We normally start with a savory pie, the apple crumble/pumpkin. My favorite martini is the key lime pie.
If you have a chance to visit you really should make a special stop here!","Justin P.","I've had the strawberry rhubarb pie and the berry pie. Both delicious. Love that they give a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Drinks are pricey but look interesting. I feel bad coming here without ordering a drink but their pies are just too good. Excited to try the rest of the menu, possibly a savory pie my next visit!
Interior is similar to what you expect of a bar, dim lit and small. I personally like it a lot, but it is a bit hard to move around inside. Staff are friendly.
If you're craving pie just come here. You wont be disappointed (can also get takeout).","Joe M.","This place is super unique and one of my favorite stops in Seattle after the dinner rush. Very simple menu of an assortment of pies and really good mixed drinks. The apple crumb pie is my favorite and it's cooked perfectly. All you need to do is walk right up to the window and shop for a good piece of pie! You'll get a nice piece of pie on a to go plate with a fork so you can continue on your journey as you indulge. you can also go inside that has a few seats if you want a nice dessert experience with a drink. We tried their chocolate martini and it was made really well. The only downside to going inside is that your potential to have another piece of pie just went up! That being said, the strawberry rhubarb pie is sooooo goooooood!","Rebecca B.","Pie bar is the dream pie shop I want to open when I'm a 65 year-old hip Grandma living in Seattle. 5-stars for the pie. Is it pricey? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely. Who doesn't want to have Pietinis and slices of pie?!
Strawberry rhubarb pie is the pie you were missing every summer, every dream, every day of your life. Must have. Pair it with any Pietini of your liking to complete the dream.
I've been to both the Ballard and Capital Hill locations which are very different. There is limited seating at the Capital Hill location in case you have a large party. Pie and drinks wise the locations are probably the same, but the atmosphere is much more modern and the shop is more spacious in Ballard. It honestly looks like a rustic bachelorette party inside and I love it. This is not just a place for ladies! On their website the baker says they created Pie Bar to make people happy, and they have succeeded. "" An hour at Pie Bar is an hour of therapy.""","Sachi E.","I've waited to come here for a few years as I only recently 1) turned 21 and 2) had the time to come out here! The pie was DELICIOUS. The service was great and it's the perfect spot for a chill evening with drinks! :)","Jerry C.","The pie bar was ok, Pie was really good. Drinks where just ok. Not completely amazing but ok. I got an old fashion and it wasn't the best one of had. Ordered one of the Pietini drinks and it was good.
Pietini run $11 so not a cheap drink. The old fashion was also $11. So not necessarily the place to come if you think you are looking for cheap drinks. The place is small so not a whole lot of room there.
In summary I'd probably stop by for take out pie.","Jevons J.","Went to this place on a Tuesday night and it was relatively empty, which was great! No line . The atmosphere was pretty hip and the lights were dim, which I didn't mind.
We ordered the pumpkin pie, Apple Pie Moscow mule, and the Ron burgundy. The pumpkin pie was pretty average but I wished I got the desert island or the buffalo chicken pie that the servers told us were the most popular.
The service was really good and the servers were really friendly.
Overall, I'd recommend others to try this place out.","Koral C.","The coolest bar you'll go to in Seattle. It's tiny, so not the best for a group and also it fills up very fast - but a must see! They are serving up beer, craft cocktails and PIETINI'S. Yes you read that right and I'm here to say they are delicious. They are baking pies at the bar, right in front of you. The pie is all amazing, you can't go wrong. It's eclectic and homey inside with lights and pitchers hanging from the ceiling. There's also a window you can just stop by and grab a slice of pie to go.","Shelia D.","We went here after a Christmas party to grab some pie and some drinks. And what an amazing concept this bar has: pies and alcohol. Brilliant!
It's located on the main street and it's fairly small but you can't miss it whatsoever because of the colorful hanging lantern lights and the window that is coming out with a display of pies behind it. We got lucky with parking and also getting a table. We looked over the menu quickly and espresso martini was what captured my attention along with the coconut cream pie and a the mud pie.
Not long after my drink was out followed by the pies. That espresso martini was probably one of the best martinis I've had in a very long time. The waitress told me that the secret was that they make the drink with cold brew. I took one bite from each pies and I was instantly in heaven. The coconut cream pie was very tasty and full of coconut flavor. It was delicious and very fresh. The mud pie was very dense and extremely delicious full of peanut butter flavor. That was also absolutely tasty!
Overall it was a fantastic experience here and I highly recommend it to anyone that is in the mood for some good drinks and/or pies.","Kristin F.","This tiiiiny place is so packed with good stuff! It's a really fun late-night spot to satisfy those sweet cravings. We came here last night to cap off my birthday and had such a great time. I'm just sad that I live 4 hours away! Probably for the best though, cuz I'd be here far too many times per week.
The atmosphere was a micro-sized, divey, loud metal-music-playing gem, wedged into a strange triangular shaped space. I was surprised we even got a seat here, late on a Saturday night, but we filled the last 2 spots. They have sooo many pies! Savory and sweet - they all looked awesome. But we'd already eaten dinner so this trip was strictly for dessert purposes.
I got a chocolate pie-tini and my husband got a hot toddy. Oh my gosh my drink was so good. I could sip those all night. Topped these dessert cocktails off with a buttery hot slice of apple pie, and it might have been the best apple pie I've ever had. It had a perfect ratio of crust/crumble to filling, and the apples were super cooked down and soft. I may have even been able to eat the whole pie. I was sitting right by the area where they are displayed and the only thing stopping me was a thin wall of glass barrier haha.
Thanks Pie Bar for being a fun last stop on a great day! This was the perfect ending.","Kurt S.","Oh the Pie Bar. One of my 'must-go' places on my list when I visited Seattle a couple months ago. It definitely lived up to the hype!
It's a really small place on the corner, but don't let that fool you. Their pies were amazing. I also got a chocolate cake martini and that was amazing as well.
If I'm in the Seattle area again soon, I will definitely be stopping by the Pie Bar for a late night dessert!","Quyen H.","Absolutely love love love this place!
This is a total hole in the wall. Literally. They operate out of this tiny place where you place your order by this window. I swear everything on their menu is delicious. I absolutely love the strawberry rhubarb pie. The crust is so delicious. It tastes great warm so eat fast! but it also tastes great if you heat it up at home too. something about the topping they put on their pie is unlike anything I've ever eaten. The filling is not too sweet where it overpowers the pie and you'd get bored of it. It's so good!
This is a must try place in Seattle!","Mei P.","Pie Bar is such a unique restaurant that is so Seattle. As the name says, they sell pies. You can get pieces by the slice either from their outdoor side window or you can go inside for a sit down. The restaurant itself is very small. You seat yourself so when our group of three went inside, it felt like we were nudging bodies as we waddled towards the free bar seats. I would suggest if you were to come here with a group (aka bigger than a party of 2) to get the pies to go. It's not worth going through the hassle of getting seats inside.
My friend got the chocolate pie which turned out to be more of a mousse than we expected. Bf and I shared the Strawberry Rhubarb. It had a good amount of sweetness and tartness! I really enjoyed the pie. The vanilla ice cream on the side was alright. It wasn't anything special- which makes sense I mean they are called the Pie Bar.
They have a variety of pies categorized in sweet to savory. The menus is rotating with a couple of classic pies that remain on the menu from month to month but it does bring a bit of excitement to those who frequent the establishment with new treats every visit. Definitely would recommend coming here if you are in Seattle and looking for a warm dessert.","Bonnie C.","My friends and I decided to come here after a late movie premiere. We had a group of 12, and learned upon arrival that they're not the greatest for large groups. Thankfully, they do take out orders, so we were able to order our pies and hang out together on the street.
The majority of us stuck to the sweet pies, Apple Crumble, Strawberry rhubarb crumble, and deserted island. All three of the flavours were delicious and we'd definitely order them again.
When you order take out, they ask if you want it warmed, and if so, they grab the slice, put it into a cardboard box, and then microwave it before giving it to you. If you're not a fan of microwaved pie, heads up.
Things to note: Parking is street parking only. There's no garbage can out on the streets to throw your garbage out once you're done, so you'll need to ring the bell and let the staff know you'd like the box to be thrown away.","May O.","It was honestly alright and pretty pricey. I asked for the most popular pie and it was the strawberry rhubarb crumble. I got it and had high expectations. However the pie was overpowered by the berries. I would have liked to taste another flavor.","Nina T.","The pies were delicious! I got the strawberry rhubarb and butter beer, while my fiancé got coconut creme pie and apple pie Moscow mule. I literally inhaled my slice! If you have a sweet tooth definitely check this place out!
If you don't have a sweet tooth, it's okay they have other options. I really liked that they also offered savory pies. The spot is pretty small, so don't really recommend if you have a large group. But, don't worry they have a window you can order from and take out. They're also open until 2, so great for after a night out on cap hill.
Their cocktails hit the spot too, the apple pie Moscow mule literally tasted like apple pie. They also have a lot of different pie inspired cocktails, can't wait to try some more.","Paulina H.","* Dessert place *
Pie bar is my all time favorite bar! I used to come here with my best friend almost every week until I gained 3 lbs. ugh!
I usually get apple pie moonshine mule and a deserted island pie. It has all types of berries in it. The crust is so good and smell so buttery. I like their pie because they have the right amount of sweetness.
I would recommend to go to the one in Ballard if you have a big group because it's bigger and easier to find a spot.
Food: 10/10
Service: 10/10
Environment: 10/10 (the one in cap hill is super crowded and the place is so small and cute, highly recommend to order take out)","Melody L.","If you don't mind waiting outside for a long time and shelling out more money than you expect, come to Pie Bar for some damn good pie. Came here on a rainy night and had to wait forever at the to-go window just to get a slice of the Desserted Island and some ice cream. The reason why it took so long was because there was only one person handling the orders and food prep, and he was taking his sweeeet time like there wasn't a long line of people waiting in the rain.
The mix of various berries and apple in the pie was nice, but the best part of the pie was the crumble. I wish I could have just the crumble because it was really that good. Too bad that I ended up paying ~$10 for pie with ice cream but did not receive that much pie or ice cream. Also I'm not sure how fresh their pies actually are since I saw slices being microwaved and then served...","Rum G.","Very cute dessert+drink place in capital hill. The apple crumble pie was so good and apple pie mule went well with the pie. I would definitely recommend this place!"

Staffs were awesome. Food was delicious. Kids got to enjoy the lights off and glow-bowling experience. We even got glow stick necklaces.","John C.","They got me with the budget cuts...
Grabbed a pizza while we had the kids out bowling.
The menu says ""Wall To Wall Pepperoni - for $21.65.""
The menu statement and the bowling alley must have a very different understanding on what ""Wall To Wall Pepperoni"" actually is.
Now, I'm posting the photo's and you tell me....
Am I missing something right here?
Like half of the pepperoni??..
If the kids hadn't killed half the pizza I would of sent it back.
I did mention it when I went back up for another beer and the girl said that was a normal pizza.
At least take the Wall To Wall Pepperoni part off the menu, or put the rest of the Pepperoni on there....","Alex H.","Good bowling alley.
3 stars for customer service from the manager. She was in between bites and shoving food down her throat in between helping me at the front desk and licking her fingers between bites.
I have to say their pancakes are delicious LOL but eat lunch on yo break!","Johnny L.","Narrows Bowling
Fun, Fun, Fun... 3 times n I'll walk u thru wat I mean..
But, I gotta warn u that the commercial I'm about 2 tell u is pretty rough.. walking in2 the entrance n in2 the hallway.. the restrooms looked old w/ no mirrors n missing door handles, pretty run down so far.. but place was full of life w/ happy kids n family bowling..
Fun #1 or 1st fun: bowling.. u can change different themes on the layout of the screen scoreboard
Fun #2: u have a big ol' arcade area where u can win tickets.. games such as racing, basketball, shooting
Fun #3: the lounge looks well dated/aged but the bartender brings it 2 life w/ her personality n the basic Maker's Mark w/ ginger ale taste right
Final thought, let's bring in Jerry Springer: I think if I stick around long enough @ this place, I may find Earl Anthony artifacts
It's my 400th review; shout out 2 all of u Yriends out there!","Waldy G.","This place sucks! Save your money and go somewhere else. We payed for 2 hrs and weren't even able to finish the first game and when we went to the front desk to inquire about the time issue we were told that the lanes had gotten reserved by another party and that he couldn't do anything about it with a shitty attitude and that we had to move. Terrible customer service!","Jonah R.","Well, I've almost been here before, and decided to go today with my son. We got two pairs of shoes and 3 games of bowling, for 52$. Definitely more than most places.
There was one kid working the counter, which was being overwhelmed, when another worker came up eating some food, asking him when he's being relieved (while I was being served) like I wasn't even there. She walked away disinterested.
We went to bowl and the attendant only put one person in the computer, then there was the kid bowling ramp in the lane, which I moved, and then I had to ask him to lower the gutter rails that were up. It took us about 5 minutes until we were ready to actually bowl.
After bowling I gave my son some tokens and went to order food, chicken fingers and fries and fish and fries. We got a buzzer while we played.
They do have a big selection of games, all take tokens, which one of the change machines wasn't working.
It must have seriously been 50 minutes to 1 hour for our food to make it out.
The whole time we were in the arcade, which with it's good variety, was also a bit overpriced, two games I played didn't work, the skeeball and one of the football ones. My buzzer didn't even go off, for the food.
I just had to go up about 6 times and politely stand there every 10 minutes of so hoping they'd get the hint that it's been FOREVER. There we're 3 workers back there, but it just looked really disorganized and frantic. Instead of dropping the fries and chicken at the same time, they were all done separately. I watched 4 different people come up and get food that ordered after me.
The food was really salty and overcooked, yeah we got battered fish and chicken tenders but they were both really overdone, while the fries were underdone and way over salted.
All said and done, I probably wouldn't go back. Just seemed overpriced and customer service was definitely lacking.
52$ for bowling (poor service)
20$ for fish and chicken tenders (overcooked)
15$ in tokens
Not worth it in my opinion. There are better places","Jon R.","But why tho? Is my whole thought process here.
Look I get it. Bowling alleys are dying out, like arcades, and mom and pop shops.
Pacific Lanes is getting the axe, and in a few years who knows what will become of this place.
But it's still no excuse to get caught slacking on your pimpin..
Look here's the sitch, I rolled through, on a sunday, lunch time, had a work thing. Y'all would think it's quiet and slow, maybe some short and quick service get some vittles and put some balls in holes...
So I come in try to pay for bowling... Two games easy right? Bippity boppity back the fuck up because it took this lady 17 minutes to figure out how much to charge us and whether or not we are charged for shoe rental. Sorry but my back hurt from doing her job for her. She didn't know her anus from elbow, and kept looking at the screen like someone switched the language setting to Mandarin.
Fast forward I decide to order food, all I wanted was some ""Super Nachos"". There were like 10-15 people in the entire places and only 6 or 7 of them actually order food.
1. The lady taking orders an older lady, very sweet and treated me very kindly.
2. You're given a pager to send you into a false sense of security that you might actually get to eat today.
3. Literally everyone who ordered food, had to wait between 45-75 minutes for food. (so glad I didn't come hungry, by the time I ate I was chewing at my wrists. Honestly I can't remember if it was to have sustanence or to kill myself to stop hunger pains.)
4. Can we talk about how Not super these fucking nachos were? Like they looked okay at first. Like how cab something be salty and flavorless? Also the chips were stale a f, and felt like someone cut out cardboard pictures of chips and covered it with cheese. Also the cheese sauce......was it cheese? I feel like it was some large animals sperm in large quantities.... I feel pregnant... Anyway it wasn't good..
5. WHY HOT JIZZ CHEESE BUT COLD ASS TACO MEAT?! (WHY!?)
Any way im not totally gonna trash this place, but there's no excuse for sub par service on a slow day... Apparently this is a routine for them on days when certain staff aren't here.. 3 stars is the best I can do. You're better than this narrows... If this wasn't 1 of 3 bowling alleys left in town. I'd skip this place entirely.
Make you're own judgement tho..","Greg O.","I'm not a huge fan of their food, but I love the place. If you know me, I'm a pretty avid bowler, so finding an alley around my residence is important. I don't hate some of the others nearby, but if I get to choose I pick Narrows. Usually mid day is totally chill - league is happening but they still have some lanes available for old timers such as myself. Go Narrows!","Katie J.","I currently live near Austin, TX but have been back in WA caring for an ill family member for the past two months.
I brought my bowling gear with me because I wanted to stay in shape for my 2 leagues back home. Narrows was the closest bowling alley to where my sister lives, and I used to bowl there many years ago, so that's where I practiced 2-3 times a week.
I have to say the crew there has been amazing as my ""home away from home"" the past two months. Special shout outs to BRENDA and CLAYTON who have been just great. Also to the manager, CHRIS, who was answering questions for me via email before I even arrived.
Machines appear to be well maintained and I hardly had any issues. Never even had to call for a ball return.
Thanks guys for taking care of me. I had a great experience there....even if my score didn't always reflect it lol","K M.","We pretty much go here for the decent prices and location.
Downside:
Rental shoes: last time they were in bad shape they handed them to me with something spilled on them from last renter..
Glow bowl: should be called disco bowl. A kid in our large group had to stop because they got so dizzy.
Skip anything that should be a hot snack: We warn people that bowl with us but when they're hungry and get something anyways -they always end up throwing it out. Lol
The bar: Ordered beer for our group, paid leaving a large tip & went back to bowling. Beer never showed up so I went back in the bar to see what was going on. The bartender said they don't bring it out & I had to show them receipt since guy that took order left- took a while for them to get a picture of beer..","Delicia H.","Had super fun only problem was no red bull joined the restaurant bowling league had a blast great time cant wait too bring kids too bowl","Courtney A.","Very clean place! Little on the expensive side compared to the other bowling alleys in the area. We had fun!","Angelo C.","A good local bowling alley. Great food and deals and the arcade is decent. Way across the parking lot there is a play area/arcade/food place called Odyssey 1 and it is GREAT and SO FUN for kids. I know I had such a blast there when I was little. What I loved to do when I was little was go bowling here, then just drive up across the parking lots to Odyssey 1. You will really get exhausted but VERY worth the fun. Also, right across from this building is an old theatre named Galaxy Narrows 8 Theatre. I wish it was still open although it was very old but it was a really great theatre. What was really good about these places around was that you could go bowling and then watch a movie at Galaxy. It closed in 2013. They should really renovate or demolish that theatre and open up a brand new one... All the way in Tukwila (around Seattle) there is a fun little place called ACME Bowl and they have a GIANT claw machine. My family and I would always win big prizes and my siblings and I just wished there was one close by because that game is fun for all ages lol... Then later that August of 2015, my family and I drove past this bowling alley and realized that we haven't been here in YEARS. We went there and there it was! THE BIG CLAW! We were so excited and happy. We've been winning big prizes since and now our basement is packed with them... Anyways been going here since I was little but they should really renovate their bathrooms and their chairs near the lanes but this is a great bowling alley.","Jessica R.","Clean, especially the shoes which I appreciate. Customer service was great too. Our family bowled for one hour 25 dollars shoes included as well as 3 free sodas and a bag of coins for the arcade came with this price. Definitely a place I would return to for a family outing. I loved the vintage skeeball machine in the arcade as well","Jules K.","This review is of the High End Cafe inside the bowling alley. The staff is so awesome and helpful, but the food is pretty disappointing. The cheese fries have a really chemically flavour and I am pretty sure my coconut shrimp wasn't cooked through. Everyone was very lovely though so that makes up for it and adds a star.","Maringi L.","I can't even sing their praises enough.
Narrows Plaza Bowl, Chris Goddard your team was fantastic from the moment we arrived!! Front desk staff; consistently sweet, helpful, & professional! The food was great! My family enjoyed patty melts, mushroom burgers, & pizza; fresh, not greasy, you could taste everything on the burgers, & again the staff was polite & moved quickly. The staff moving around cleaning up were very efficient, super helpful, and again polite!! We really appreciated the help and support get ready and then setup on the day for our Relay for Life fundraiser. You have an OUTSTANDING team!
And thank YOU for honoring our cancer Survivors the way you did! APPRECIATED!
Fantastic place to Bowl & eat (my husband reports good things about the bar as well) AND a fun and profitable place for a fundraiser! RFL got a good amount of our ticket sales (we paid around $32 per lane for 2-hours, drinks and fancy shoes included) AND we get a percentage of the food our guests ate (and we ATE!)
Chris, THANKS TO YOU AND YOUR TEAM!!","Nik S.","Inexpensive fun for sure! They have a small arcade that the kids had fun collecting tickets from. They exchanged the tickets for a few candy prizes, lol. The bowling alley is full most of the time during the weekend. It's better to go early as well. They have a very good house made ginger beer (alcohol free) that is so yummy!!! Low key spot...","Matt G.","Pretty much your average Bowling Alley with all the basic needs.
Been here a couple times expecting to be the cliche bowling alley, and I was correct. The great thing is the prices around the early noon time to where it's only $6 for a couple hours.
The service was super slow when I needed a Ramp for my 2 year old.
I had to remind them 4 times and I had to pay extra for it.
Who does that?","Christopher C.","Narrows Plaza Bowl is an amazing establishment, where I always have an amazing experience! Jill, Payge and their newest employee Daenette are amazing (we have been here now more than 6-7 time). For food, drinks, fun arcade games and bowling, the fun never stops! I am always able to request music during Glow Bowl and Jill always make sure we are taken care of.
The Good Time's Lounge is where our favorite bar hands are, Tyler and Carmella; always in a good mood, both serve us the best drinks and the best times! I love going in for karaoke on Saturdays and we always bowl on Fridays (always starting in the lounge).
All in all Narrows Plaza Bowl is a great establishment for good honest fun. It is family friendly, but for adults is even better. I love how I am always taken care of, and there is always room for me and my crew. Will be back again tonight--I literally come here every weekend.
Love you guys at NPB!
-Christopher & Family","Nick D.","I like coming to this place a lot. I'm usually here on Fridays in the arcade where me and some friends own a machine. The staff that works here gives it their all, and I really appreciate that.
There is ample parking for even the busiest of nights. And there is a large amount of lanes available for those who are actually here to bowl.
The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is the food. Granted some of it is good, I'm not a huge fan of most of it. But hey, what can you really expect of a bowling alley.
Prices are reasonable and there is always the arcade if you want to just do that!
Come check my friends and I out on Friday nights in the arcade on the ""in the groove"" machine!"
"Bar Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kayla P.","One of my all-time favorite places in Seattle! The interior is charming and perfect for anything from date night to celebratory dinner. It is a bit small, so I wouldn't bring larger parties here.
The food is incredible! It's authentic and well worth the price. I always get the burrata and fried artichokes to start and finish with the pappardelle alla bolognese. Delicious!","Clint W.","hmm, this is the baby to the others and its a cute little place. it's tiny and I admit it felt a little claustrophobic inside, but it had some shoosh to it. it is def cozy and dark inside. it was quite picturesque, people watching on cold evening in the city.
even though we were packed in, I could hear my friend from across the table and we could have a conversation. because it was late, we fired out our orders quickly.
I had spaghetti with guanciale, which I was looking forward to. it had a little bit of heat to it and maybe it was a bit overdone, but it was a solid dish. the menu is a bit small, but I will need to come back.","Chris K.","Nice date night spot. Cozy dark, neighborhoody. We were seated at the bar which is a bit tight but got to watch small kitchen action. Burata was OK nothing to write home about but nice presentation. I had pasta bolognese which is a simple dish and was similarly nicely presented. Friend had gnoochi which was presented in a schooner bowl and seemed quite heavy (he thought it was only ok). Service was friendly. Menu is small which I like.
I'm giving this 3 star not because it was bad, its was as the guide says, OK (virtually everything on yelp is 4 stars given by people who can't boil water). Would I eat here again? Sure. Would I travel across town to eat here? Probably not.","Kayesee S.","Wow. I'm so disappointed to lower my rating from 5 stars to 2. I had a pretty terrible experience here my second time. I was so excited to come back here for the second time but left feeling disappointed.
When I sat down at our table, the glass on the table had lipstick on it. I asked for a new glass and got one quickly. It didn't bother me at the time. Mistakes happen.
What was most upsetting is that we never had a server. There was a server helping almost all the other tables, but the bartender took our order and dropped off our food. We never were checked up on or talked too. We even had a reservation so I don't know why we were treated like this. It was really sad because the food is delicious but since we seemed to be the only ones treated like this, it was upsetting. Maybe it was because we were younger than most of the other guests?
Overall the food is delicious, but we left feeling sad and disappointed.","James N.","Brought a date here, and the atmosphere is perfect for that. It is a cozy, small, intimate restaurant, so I recommend you make reservations because there aren't many tables. From the reviews, I was expecting the food to be phenomenal, but it came up a little short. Ordered the fonduta cheese, gnocchi, and fig/prosciutto pizza. Everything was fine, but nothing stood out. To be honest, I've had better pizza at MOD pizza for less than half the price, but I guess you pay for the atmosphere of dining at a cute neighborhood restaurant. The drinks were fine and the service was satisfactory. I parked on the street a block away, at least parking was more plentiful than if the restaurant was located downtown. Overall, I wasn't blown away by anything, I would give this place a 3.5, but rounded up to a 4 to be nice.","Jenny Z.","Came here on a Saturday afternoon for early dinner before an early hike the next day. Was not expecting happy hour on a weekend but there was a full happy hour menu. I loved the truffle butter baguette (only $4 on happy hour). The butter was so creamy I ended up putting it on everything (caesar, clams, clam bread etc). We split the spaghetti which was extremely doughy and fresh. Nor a large portion but perfect for us since we had already snacked on apps and wanted to just try a pasta.
We'll be back for sure for the happy hour again and interested in trying the rotating seafood/meat main courses! Good value!","Jessica N.","I have to give 5 stars because this place is just such a little gem!! I fell in love with the ambiance - small intimate and cozy. Our waitress was so friendly and great. And the food was superb. I can't stop thinking about that amazing tiramisu! Only thing to note: it's small so great place for date night or small dinner crew not a large party.","Austin H.","I loved everything about this place. The space was intimate with charming decor. Our server, Jeanine, was extremely kind and helpful throughout the evening. The food was wonderful. To start we got some slightly charred bread with a delicious white truffle butter that we consumed in its entirety. Then came the clams and gnocchi and those were probably my two favorite dishes of the evening. Then the pizza and risotto followed and at this point we were already starting to get full so we took half of each home to make a small amount of room for dessert. It was nice to see sizable and shareable portions. Because we were so full we shared these little nutella stuffed doughnuts with mascarpone and it was a wonderful finishing touch. Next time my family is in town this is a spot I plan on taking them to because of the quality and quantity.","Lisa M.","This has become our favorite special occasion spot in Seattle. The cozy candlelit feeling and warmth from the moment you walk in is so inviting. One experience that has been very representative of the service we've received here; we had a reservation for our anniversary and they were slightly late to seat us, not a big deal or long wait at all - however they went out of their way to apologize and served us complimentary prosecco until our table was ready. Even the wait was fun with how kind they were!
Beyond the service, the food is incredible every. single. time. The rosemary pasta that the bolognese comes with is memorable and a favorite. Their pizzas are also always incredible, the nduja sausage is unique and our favorite for the depth of flavor in the sausage and the crust.
One of the best experiences and meals we've had in Seattle!","Liana R.","Dear Cantinetta,
Even when my boyfriend doesn't know how to play with blocks and dumps his pizza all over himself, you save the day and serve up another delicious, homemade gem in its place. I love sitting at the bar by the kitchen chatting about the meal prep, although I wish if you ordered too much baguette from the local boulangerie, you would donate it instead of tossing in the trash. Your cocktails are bomb, service stellar and pizzas amazeballs. Good thing we live closeby otherwise we'd have a huge carbon footprint getting over here.
xxo,
Liana","Frankie K.","Went here for date night and was very impressed. We got seated in the back of the restaurant in a bar style section overlooking the chefs... and let me just say, I think this was the most coveted seat in the place. During the time we were there we heard multiple come in asking for the seats. As fun as it was to was watch the food being made, we couldn't help feeling awkward!!! What is the protocol here?!?! Are you supposed to talk to the chefs??? They're basically sitting at your table with you.. what do you do?!???
Despite feeling like newbs and not knowing the 'right' way to handle our sitting situation. Everything was perfect. Atmosphere was warm, cozy, and romantic!pizza and pasta were delish. Yummy cocktails. Highly recommend! Just be sure to make reservations- it's a tiny place!","Mindy D.","Grabbed dinner here for the second time. Such a great spot! The first time we went we sat at the bar and got to watch all the food being made. It was awesome. This time we sat at a corner table and it was great too we got the fried artichokes. So good! For dinner I got the crab risotto and my partner got the nduja sausage pizza. Both were fantastic. I think the risotto was a little salty. I think the kitchen was a little heavy handed on salt (even the artichokes were a little salty). The first time we came here that wasn't the case everything was seasoned perfectly. For dessert we got the zeppole. Such a great restaurant and becoming a favorite of ours!","A Y.","Would have been four stars but at the end of our happy hour seated at the bar a cockroach crawled right over the bar top and under the silverware tray... Nice cocktail but wouldn't eat there again for cleanliness reasons.","Nicole W.","Love this little place! Small seasonal menu, Food is always good, the staff is so nice and it's just a cute space with indoor and outdoor seating! I prefer the space during the summer where you can sit outside and they have all the doors open because it can get a little hot inside since the kitchen is right there at the bar and it's such a small space so I usually don't like to sit at the bar.","Denise G.","I had the crab risotto and a peroni. I must say it was simply AMAZING! So much flavor and nice big chunks of crab.","Sarah Y.","Great food and even better drinks! Such a great place for a date or special night out.","Jen L.","Delicious!
-Truffle cheese. It was just ok.
-Cesear salad- delicious and fresh with mixed greens rather than the regular boring lettuce.
-Clam- delicious and savory. Not rubbery. I wish there was more bread to dip in the delicious broth
-Bolognase is amazing! Love the pile of fresh grated Parmesan, noodles are perfectly cooked.
Cocktails are great. Service is very nice. Chef is also so nice to chat with a bit!","Julie L.","Now, this place can get loud as mud, which for someone that has hearing issues, is a freaking dining nightmare BUT see how I still gave them 5 stars? ( owner, if you're listening, putting in some ceiling noise dampeners would be sooo appreciated )
I've walked by and stared into the windows here many a times wishing to check it out. I had high expectations based solely on the cuteness factor. Finally got a chance to go and expectations were met and then some. We shared two starters, a serving of bread and one main entree. Not to mention a fancy ass bottle of Delille D2 DELICIOUS wine.
We had the cauliflower and the beef carpaccio starters. The beef carpaccio was beautiful to look at and beyond tasty. Like beyond. I could have easily had 5 more plates of it. It's not huge but it's a flavor bomb. The cauliflower was seasoned and prepared perfectly, and I don't really even like cauliflower. The rustic bread was happily smothered by me with the truffle butter that came along with it. Our finale was the spaghetti. Best spagetti, ever. Perfect homemade noodles, amount of sauce, meat chunks and adorned with the best mound of freshly grated parmesan cheese and herbs. Heaven.
When I go back, I need to try the bolognese next.
Shout out to Hugo, for his recommendations, his appropriate loud voice and his patience with me and my wine sampling and food allergy self.","Stephanie H.","We originally intended to come for restaurant week, not realizing that RW menu is only Sunday through Thursday (rookie mistake), but it actually worked out really well for us! We chose to explore some items that weren't on the RW menu and had a great experience. The place was still bustling at 8 PM (we had a reservation). Staff are super friendly and all-around great.
We were seated at what is essentially the chef's counter and had front-row seats watching the chef/owner cook. I was super impressed watching him cook for the whole restaurant in this tiny kitchen on a four-burner electric stove and being able to see the process made the food taste even better.
Food was delicious. We started with the clams, which were in a piping-hot, very mildly spicy tomato-based sauce. The picci amatriciana was, to quote my BF, the best tomato-based pasta he's had in the past couple of years. Seared scallops were also very good. Overall a great experience. Bar Cantinetta is a true neighborhood gem and I will definitely be back!","Carla R.","The arancini and papardelle were so spicy that minutes after eating each, my mouth was on fire. I've had the papardelle before and it wasn't like this at all. I'm very sensitive to heat (spice) and nowhere on the menu was this change noted or listed. I would not have ordered it if I had known. Too bad, this dish used to be good, but it was so hot I couldn't even taste it. Really disappointed. Won't be back. Consistency matters, as do accurate descriptions. There's no need for arancini or papardelle bolognese to have that level of kick, definitely not what is expected or wanted."
"Pizzeria Pulcinella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-pulcinella-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Ly T.","I recently moved; was looking for a good place to eat nearby. Best place hands down in the neighborhood.
I have been there many times now and tried a lot of their specialty pizzas. All are really good.
But I'm a basic person. My pizza of choice is pepperoni. The owner there is very welcoming and hooks me up with the best pepperoni pizza every time. Extra pepperoni!!!!!
Love that I'm in walking distance.","Briana N.","Great service at this restaurant!!! Our server was very friendly and checked on us frequently.
My sister and I ordered a starter salad (large) and it was plenty for the both of us.
We each ordered our own pizzas which were prepared very quickly! Apparently their oven cooks pizza in 90 seconds! We were very impressed.
The pizza was cooked pretty well. I would've liked mine cooked a tad out longer since I prefer my cheese thoroughly melted. Other than that, the flavors were delectable.
I only ate 3 slices so I boxed the rest of my food.
Can't wait to eat my leftovers!!!","Brooke B.","The pizza flavors were on point, but the execution was lacking. Very soggy middles on all of our pizzas. Soda beverages didn't taste quite right, and were then requested new ones. Wasn't any better, though the server said they should be fine even though they ""couldn't"" check the machines in the basement.
Service was ok...not great. Barely got a smile at the end, and we seemed to be a chore.
Not likely to return.","John H.","Pizzeria Pulcinella
Valoriani pizza oven
See Naples and die - or just trot over to Rainier Beach and have an authentic southern Italian pie!
According to their website, Pulcinella is brought to you by the same folks who own and operate Vince's. And, it has been ""certified Neapolitan"" by the Verace Pizza Napolitana Association since 2009.
The pizzeria is in a rustic building with high ceilings and expansive windows. The restaurant has a cozy feeI with table and bar seating, as well as a pizza counter where I grabbed a front row seat.stopped in on a rainy Wednesday night and was greeted by a friendly and helpful staff.
At the recommendation of Leo, the pizza maker, I decided on the Italian sausage and bell peppers appetizer ($10), which is given a brief roasting in the pizza oven and served in the cast iron skillet. Tasty, and the red sauce was hearty and flavorful.
Completing my order was the Giovanni pie - roasted pepper & pesto sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, onion, crimini mushrooms, fresh tomatoes.
My server explained they would wait to put in the pizza order, because it bakes in just 90 seconds - and they weren't kidding. In fact, Leo, pointed out that part of their certification is a requirement to bake their pies to the 90 second mark - and - not a second more!
Molto autentico! I will try it again.","Mike H.","I'm gonna start by saying pizza is one of my favorite foods. I have been to over 20 pizza spots in Seattle and I have to say that this is one of my favorite places to get pizza. My eyes are tearing up just writing this review.
They make each pizza per order and they use fresh ingredients. The staff is nice and they have a lot of options to choose from. It has a very rustic pizza parlor feel and the dark wood interior and accents give it a real Italian vibe.
I got the Pozzuoli and when I tell you I inhaled this pizza I'm not lying. I don't even think it made it to the 5 minute mark. The crust was the perfect and there was not too much sauce on the pizza. The pepperoni was fresh and so were the mushrooms. It had the perfect bite and the pizza crust was good too. I have nothing negative to say about this place. I have been here 4 times now and each time has gotten better and better.","Shevaani S.","This is one of our frequent eateries. Most time we end up ordering multiple small plates/appetizer items. My mom favors their eggplant parmigiana. My favorite in the appetizer is their Caprese salad, tomatoes always seem to be flavorful and cheese fresh. My niece and nephew love their dessert chocolate pizza.
All items are house made, tastes fresh and flavorful. Staff is very nice and friendly.

***Would definitely recommend this place****","Kathleen C.","This place came highly recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint. It's a cute neighbor pizza place in what looks like someone's home from the outside.
Best thing about the food was 1) the pizza dough/crust 2) pepperoni, it's like seasoned or something but super good! We also tried the lasagna which was good with the ground meat being the highlight. I do still enjoy the pizza more though so I'd return for more of that. The weird thing to me was the middle of the pizza was super soggy. So I couldn't pick it up, but my friend says that's how pizza is in Naples. I cannot confirm or deny, so I'll take her word for it. The soggy part tasted fine though just usually not preferred.","Ramona H.","Terrible experience. Waste of time and money. Flavorless, soggy in the middle, and definitely shouldn't be called pizza. Really don't understand why it's rated so highly. Giving it two stars because our server was nice. Won't be going back.","Claire B.","This place is fantastic!! Super authentic Italian pizza made in a wood fire pizza oven. You know it's authentic when you need a knife and a fork to eat it because the crust is so perfectly thin! And while we're on the crust... it's so delicious and crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside. Pizzeria Pulcinella seems to place a lot of weight in the quality of the ingredients - from the olive oils to the tomatoes used in the pizza sauce to the prosciutto di Parma on the pizza. This place is very cozy on the inside and the service is very friendly! Location-wise it's a little far out but definitely well worth the drive! Can't wait to go back :)","Miss Ninja `.","After reading several great reviews from people that have traveled to Italy or are Italian, I told my bf that we had to try this restaurant.
We went on Friday night and got there about 7:30 pm. The restaurant was packed. The only available seating was at the bar, which I thought was perfect. It sat us in front of the kitchen and it was the best view in the house.
The staff was very friendly and was attentive to us. We started with the Caesar salad, meatballs with marinara sauce and foccacia bread. Everything was great. We could have just been happy with ordering just that and dessert. But we also had to try the pizzas.
The timing of when our pizza came out to us was perfect. After we finished our appetizers, we didn't wait too long for it to arrive. It gave us enough time to digest our food. We ordered the Margherita and Diavola. The pizzas look amazing. I loved the taste, ingredients and the crust. I'm not a big fan of Margherita pizza, but this one was great tasting and I liked it very much. I love the spicy olive oil and the pepperoni in the Diavola pizza. The owner came to talk to us after our meal. We told him it was our first time and everything was great.
For dessert, we got the mocha decadence cake. It was amazing! Yuuuuuummmm.
I would definitely come back and bring my sister here, who's been to Italy, and see what she thinks.
Review to be continued...","Kristy R.","We had our monthly Manhattan Mama's dinner out last night! This time it was a pizzeria! I apologize my pictures are not on point as we kept eating the food so quickly, it was great! We ordered clams, burrata platter, sausage with roasted peppers, salami and cheese board with marinated vegetables, Pulcinella salad, and the diablo pizza!
The owner Vince was there visiting with guests. He was very happy to see us and nice enough sent over a dessert! An amazing pastry filled with Nutella!
Definitely liked the vibe of the restaurant! It is cozy inside, decorated nicely, service was good and it got busy quickly. We found out the pizza oven was shipped straight from Italy. There is no real kitchen as the food is freshly prepared and stuck straight into the oven to be cooked.
One might drive by this little location if you didn't know any better so make sure you stop in and give it a try! We will be back for sure. Parking was easy and free!","Tracey N.","Really great charming roadside pizzeria and the staff is welcoming and helpful. We sat at the bar area to watch them make the fresh wood-fires pizza. We topped off dinner with a Nutella calzone for dessert and it was delicious.","Chelsea R.","THIS PLACE DESERVES ALL THE STARS!
Okay, now that I have your attention, I'll take it down a notch, although, I really shouldn't because they deserve as much;)
My husband lived in Italy for a few years while serving in the Navy and really fell in love with the food and the culture there. So while I was casually surfing Yelp I came upon this place, and the reviews that kept referring to its Italian authenticity. I knew I had to bring him here.
Like many others stated before, the place is on the small side. And parking can be a little rough. We got there at 7pm on a Friday night and it was busy. We ended up parking on the street next to the restaurant, it really wasn't that big of a deal. It definitely doesn't look like much on the outside, but you can tell with how paced it is, that its gotta be something special.
We went in and every table was taken. There were two spots at the bar that face into the open kitchen and we were totally fine with that. Gave us something fun to watch while we were waiting for our food. My husband was instantly in heaven once we were seated and we could take it all in. The decor, the set up, everything was ""spot on"", says he.
Our server was quick to greet us and get things started. We both got a glass of wine. I chose mine based upon a prior Yelp reviewers Tip by Greg B who said to try the ""Montepulciano D' Abruzzo"" and WOW did that not disappoint! A nice wine, full of flavor. My husband got the Chianti because thats his favorite. He really enjoyed it. It was a bit too light for my tasting.
For dinner we got the Giovanni per all of the recommendations on Yelp. I think is was between that or the Diavola (which had a bunch of good reviews as well) but we just decided on the Geo and it was GREAT! Not to mention we timed it and I think it was 90 seconds it took from the pizza to go from the oven to our plates. Incredible! Easily the best and most authentic pizza we have had.
We finished off with some Spumoni which was again, delicious.
Truly everything here tasted heavenly. The food comes out fast so I can see how tables can be turned quickly, unless you have people wanting to stay and chat. But its well worth the wait! I hope that they open up another location, because it would really do well!
We will definitely be back again and again!","Omar A.","Cozy brick oven pizza place with nice ambiance. Crust was perfect and so were the ingredients. I got a margarita pizza with mushrooms. Wonderful. Also split a pear and Gorgonzola salad and split a Spumoni for dessert. If your looking for pizza in Seattle, search no more and just indulge and skip the diet for a day. You deserve it!","Cindy I.","Good quality ingredients but soggy crust and skimpy on the basil for the margarita base pizza. The basil had some big pieces on one slice then a couple of others were more stem than leaf. Cute place and liked the white table wine, it was inexpensive but a good Pinot Grigio. Just not holding up to other Italian style pizzas in town.
Nice they have reservations since it is a small place and very popular. Not worth the drive for us since again some better options out there closer to home.","Kam S.","As a Jersey girl I thought I had finally found a spot in Seattle where I could get a good pie. I was immediately skeptical when I saw only red onions on the menu. I still have it a try. Let me say the flavor is great. It's the pizza making skills that are horrible. When I pulled a slice from box there was so little cheese on the pie all the toppings fell off. I also ordered green peppers and ended up with red roasted peppers. The hunt continues for good pizza on the West Coast","Chelsea M.","Truly delicious and authentic Neapolitan pizza in a quaint ambiance. We've only been one time and gotten take out one time but tried a variety of options. The meatballs were tender and well seasoned and come with a huge cup of delicious marinara...save that sauce for your pizza! Salads were fresh and tasty and served a few people at our table. Dressing is light which I prefer and appreciate. We tried three pizzas and all were good. Crust is delicious! The potato pizza was surprisingly delicious and unique. They have the nutella calzones here too, which are always a good idea but we passed this time around. Next time!!!
Baby friendly and very friendly staff. I thought their prices were fair for the quantity and quality.","Beth W.","We tried this restaurant for the first time last night. It was crowded and loud. Our server was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the caprese salad and a number 16. Both we delicious! The crust and sauce were excellent ! The building is older and the decor was very charming. We will definitely be back soon!","Chris V.","Here's a little slice of Italy in the Rainier Valley of Seattle. This a a warm and inviting place starting with a friendly greeting when you walk in. The atmosphere along with decor really does remind me of some of the little restaurants in the Italian countryside. Obviously the designer has been there before. It was cool how they make the pizza right on the counter close to customers. I enjoyed watching the show from the stretching of the dough to the final product. After that, the pizza arrived in all its glory following a delicious house salad. The the Diavola arrived and it reminded me of my time in Naples. I'm coming back here to try the rest of the menu.","Philicia S.","After years of driving by, never really pushing myself to come, I'm glad I finally did tonight. We arrived around 8:30pm on a Friday evening. Quite a bit of tight parking, we walked in and it was about 85% full, loud with a hustle and bustle of what looks to be locals and regular diners.
The moment you walk in, you smell that fresh pizza dough and toasted pizza crust scent lingering in the air. You are then greeted by a friendly smile at the host stand. You give them your party count 2 + 2 kids. They ask if we are interested in 2 crayon sets and we say yes!
we got sat on a half booth, half chair table. and menus are set in front of us and the host brings by some ice waters. as we gaze around, there are lots of interesting things placed on the walls. wine bottles and glasses, little antique looking things here and there.
we were then greeted by a sweet server, we let her know it was our first time and if she could explain the food, etc. here to us. which she happily did, she informed us of the size and what they recommended. we needed more time to browse so we talked amongst ourselves and looked closely at their menu.
We eventually decided on 2 appetizer salads. 3 pizzas and 2 drinks.
Their version of supreme #13 I believe and I got #7 and added anchovies, we got our kids a marinara based pizza with pepperoni and cheese. We started off with their arugula salad and caesar. When the server dropped it off. she brought along a plate of focaccia bread as well and offered us fresh ground pepper.
The salads were amazing. so fresh and crisp. tangy and simple dressing on the arugula salad with shaved parmesan. the caesar with housemade dressing was delicious. just absolutely perfect.
Our pizzas were yummy. lovely toasted fresh brick over pizza. super thin crust. My husband supreme pizza, was loaded with toppings that were a little overwhelming and hard to eat off the pizza since all the toppings kept falling off. My pizza the number seven with anchovies was really good it was simple, and very refreshing with arugula on top. It was a little bit too salty for me I should have not added the anchovies, but I did enjoy the pizza itself it was really different from anything I've had in Seattle.
We went ahead and ordered a soda and a raspberry Italian soda, the Italian soda was good it wasn't too sweet and just the right amount of syrup and cream ratio. Our soda was refilled. As soon as we needed it.
Eventually we were done, we definitely could not finish what we ordered, but we love having leftovers, so yay for us! We did end up ordering dessert and we got their cannoli. The cannoli was really good, it wasnt too sweet, and just the perfect amount of crunch, to finish off a delicious meal.
Server was great the whole time we got cashed out and never had to wait too long for anything. It was a really great first experience and we will definitely be back again, I just wish I pushed myself to try it sooner because now I feel like I made myself deprived all these years."
"Vendemmia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/vendemmia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Steve A.","This is our favorite restaurant in Seattle. Birthday dinner? Vendemmia. Anniversary? Vendemmia. Seattle Restaurant week? Definitely Vendemmia. Happy Hour? Vendemmia.
If you order the tasting menu you get all of the appetizers, pastas and mains to share with the table. We always go with the wine parings when we do the tasting menu. However they make some yummy and creative cocktails too so check out the drink specials too!
Our menu faves are the beef tartare, the beets and goat cheese, and practically any of their fabulous fresh pasta dishes. I will typically go with a beef or pork entree and my partner will usually have the fish. We are never disappointed.","Jenny Z.","WOW really enjoyed this place tonight. We booked a 7 pm reservation for two on a Thursday evening just for fun. Came in to a nice open bar/kitchen space with intimate table settings. There were maybe 10 tables total ranging from 2 tops to 4 tops for the most part as well as some bar seats.
Drinks - enjoyed my cocktail (union mezcal drink) but switched over to wine as it felt more fitting with pasta. Decent wine by the glass list with a lot of variety, as well as some bottle options. I really liked the Zingari Rosso which was a cherry-forward, lighter sangio blend.
Apps. I don't think we had one thing we didn't like. We started with a half dozen oysters. They weren't big but they were sure delicious. The vinaigrette was amazing. We also had beets and burrata. Beets were different than I've ever had them. They were yellow beets and more savory with herbs and arugula vs the traditional red beets with goat cheese and nuts that you can order at most places. The burrata with eggplant was a party in my mouth. The perfect mix of creamy and savory with the eggplant. The bread was oily (in a good way) and toasted to perfection.
Pasta. We ordered 3 because we couldn't choose. The squid ink tagliarini was the special of the night and my favorite one. It was savory and spicy and relatively light tasting with a good amount of dungeness crab. The tagliatelle was awesome as well with fresh egg noodles and oxtail. My least favorite was the agnolotti because it was sweet tasting and very rich (almost like a Cinnabon) but if you have a hankering for sweeter dishes, this is perfect for you. Definitely different vs other agnolotti dishes. Wouldn't order again but glad to have tried.
We passed on dessert because of the sheer amount of food we ordered but they had some interesting desserts including housemade limoncello. 2 drinks each and all that food was about $200 with tip which is a bit high for a random week day but it was well worth it and I basically have a full tagliatelle for lunch tomorrow.
We will be back! Thanks for the nice evening.","Ivy L.","A friend recommended Vendemmia to me and I'm so glad I tried it! We made reservations for a Sunday evening and we're glad we did - cause all the tables were pretty full for a Sunday evening! We were celebrating a friend's bday. Service was great and everyone was friendly. The ambiance was good for a date - Dim lighting, easy atmosphere for conversation, not super huge or cramped.
*Hamachi Crudo - I've had this at so many restaurants, I almost feel like it's overdone. But this one was so fresh and so so different! It came with a green pickled blend on top - apparently gooseberry, cucumber and basil. Fresh and delicious! 5/5
*Snap Peas - with Dungeness Crab, Endive and Chives. I've never had snap peas served this way but the dish itself is light in flavor so you get the crunch of the snap peas but can still taste the Dungeness crab. I thought it needed more flavor, especially coming out directly after the hamachi crudo. 3/5
*Burrata - Bosc Pear, Pistachio and Grilled Bread. This dish was so good! We loved everything about the burrata spread and the mix of flavors with the pear! Bread was nice and toasty! 5/5
*Beef Tartare - shallot and grilled bread. This wasn't my favorite beef tartare cause the flavors were again light and there wasn't anything special about this tartare. 3/5
*Tagliatelle with Braised Duck - O.M.G and we have a winner for the night! This pasta dish was fantastic! Noodles cooked right, sauce in point, Duck was tender small pieces and definitely not gamey. My bf doesn't like Duck and loved this dish. There was a dried mushroom in the dish that gave it a crunch. Not sure with else but it was amazing! We all said we would come back just for this dish alone!! 6/5
*Rigatoni with a Lamb Ragu, oregano and pecorino. I think Vendemmia does pasta dishes best! This one can't compare to the braised duck tagliatelle but if we came and had this dish first, it would have been just as perfect! Good Ragu sauce, pasta cooked perfectly. 5/5
*Smoked Potato - tasted like it sounds with mustard and charred onion. Ok dish - nothing to rave about. 2/5
*Rainbow Carrots with pickled green walnuts, feta and honey. Sweet and delicious! Veggies done right! 4/5
*Tri Tip Steak with Celery Root, Squash and Watercress. One of my least favorite dishes of the night. The steak was tough and the flavors were just ok. 2/5
*Pork Chop with nectarine, olive and a verde. We didn't like any of the protein dishes at Vendemmia. Pork chop was tough and none of the flavors went together in this dish. The nectarine didn't add to the dish cause of the way it was done. The olives and the verde were a weird mix. Stick to pastas and some of the sides! 1/5
*Ricotta Cake, Pear Sorbet and Panna Cotta - the pear sorbet was the winner of the 3. So good and tasted so fresh with so much pear flavors! So good that my bf has been talking about it and looking for pear sorbet the last week. Yum! Ricotta cake was a nice moist cake - nothing special. And the panna cotta was very savory if you want a savory dessert. But do yourself a favor and get that pear sorbet!
Overall, a great dining experience! I would definitely come back but now I know what to order cause there were definitely dishes we loved and dishes we hated! More good dishes than bad though! Get the pastas!!!","Dominic D.","Overall, a quaint and romantic restaurant with good value for the quality of food served. We attended as a larger group (6), and they were able to accommodate us within the back private dining area (lovely design and private).
For food, we had the following: Hamachi (all loved; fresh and balanced), Snap Peas (salad format; creative and light), Brussels Sprouts (not recommended; basic), Shelling Beans (ok), Burrata (delicious), Garganelli (beautiful smoked pork), Pure Cod (very well done; fresh; light), Spaghetti (great).
For drinks we limited our cocktails as we found variety limited. The negroni was nothing special and not worth the price. There was a great table red for $9, with heavy pours.","Liz J.","Visited for restaurant week and it was a great variety of food. We got 4 family style starters to share, am entree and a dessert each. Food was delicious, portions could have been a bit bigger. Dessert was great. Would definitely return to try more.","Carol B.","What a wonderful night out. My partner and I were craving pasta and ice cream when we decided to venture into Madrona for date night. We enjoyed some wonderful Italian food and cocktails that evening.
Food: pasta is fresh and to die for. Incredibly rich and flavorful with generous portion sizing. We started with an appetizer of oysters which were perfectly fine, but priced a bit higher than market value.
Cocktails: spirit forward and expertly made. Honestly there nothing more to say
Atmosphere: The staff was delightful. There's a small indoor are and even smaller patio seating. Interestingly, they reported being booked up on the phone but the restaurant didn't fill the entire evening. Fortunately, the patio is first come first serve so we were seated quickly when we arrived.","Alex V.","Absolutely incredible. We were here on the recommendation of my friend, and wow, all the dishes were spot on. Our shared order of beef tartare served with garlic toast was so delightful and held our appetite over until the main courses arrive. I ordered the New York prime medium-rare while my girlfriend ordered the smoked potatoes, and both dishes were so good, it was almost sad when we completed our meals lol. While the inside was a bit loud with everyone speaking, the window table facing the street of the quiet neighbourhood definitely helped detract from the noise. The decor is fantastic and the staff is super friendly. If you want a more fancy feel to your dinner, check this place out. A little on the pricey side, but absolutely worth every penny spent!","Morgan R.","Locavore Italian food for foodies, with good drink in an intimate setting. Located in the Madrona neighborhood strip, this is (along with Red Cow) is the best Madrona has to offer.
Fresh food made from scratch - prices are moderate, but this is an upscale restaurant.","Alexis L.","Very affordable, generous portions of happy hour pasta, but there are better Italian restaurants in Seattle. We came right at 5 and there was plenty of seating at the bar and patio outside. Everyone was attentive without being over bearing.","Emily D.","Cute neighborhood restaurant in Madrona. It has a small bar area in the back and a dozen or so tables, with a fully open kitchen so you can see all the happenings. We ordered the oysters, hamachi, butrata, beets, risotto, and clam pasta. All were excellent, memorable dishes and I would recommend them all. Service was wonderful with good advice about the dishes, attentive water and wine filling, and a friendly attitude. Highly recommend this for a date night or girls night with a smaller, intimate group. Don't think it would lend itself for large groups because of the layout","Sebastian T.","Came here for a friends birthday and I was intrigued to try out this highly reviewed spot. At first glance, its a classier, nice looking spot, and the menu prices confirm this first impression. Overall, it looks like a higher class tapas joint.
We ordered a few things for the table and I can attest that the food is of higher quality with its ingredients and flavor combinations refreshing & done well. My favorites were the lamb sirloin & burrata. Even though the bread was toasted a tad too long, it was hard to bite into, but simply bend the bread a bit and the crust will yield when biting into it. The cheese mixed with the hearty eggplant was a light creamy combination that was surprising. The lamb was beyond amazing with the herbs, mustard seed, and especially the mint. The rest of the dishes were pretty average. I would recommend ordering at least 1 pasta as its somewhat filling for the price compared to the other dishes. Even though I've had better pasta, I can say that its above average.
If you're looking for a nice date spot, or just some higher quality, lower quantity food, I'd recommend checking out this spot! Some items are hit or miss, but I was overall satisfied. Since the menu rotates I wouldn't mind coming back here and there, but its a bit expensive for a commonly visited spot.","Ruben A.","Here's the short version of this. Food: fantastic. Cannot be beat. Service: poor. Beyond poor.
We are visiting from California and decided we wanted good food. We have a two year old that typically does well when we take him to eat. Yesterday was not the case. The restaurant staff made it very clear this place is not child friendly. However, I will not write a whole review just on this. Here are the pros and cons.
Pros:
-Hanger steak. Delicious. Tastes like it was sous vide then finished on the grill. Perfectly done.
-Black cod was slightly fishy. Other food it was paired with was spot on and cut through the fish taste. Incredible.
- The beef tartare appetizer was savory. Meaty and beautiful.
- Hamachi appetizer in at a loss for words. Fresh. Savory.
Cons:
- Servers. Big party came in before us. I asked if they were making all their food first and if ours would be coming up. Their response ""everything is made to order and takes time to come to you."" Being from the food industry, this is an idiotic response. For one, it's an open kitchen and I can clearly see everything is being made.
- Warm/cold food. Steak was amazing, but when it arrived to us, it was warm at best.
- Inconsistent seasoning. Some dishes were almost too heavy on the salt. Some had none.
Overall, I rate the food at a 4.5 or even a five. The service a 1. Thus the 3 star rating.","Amanda C.","Best Restaurant Week restaurant!!! I'm so glad my friend brought me here (shoutout to Mona - sup girlfriend). They give the table all 4 appetizers options on the prix fixe, and you pick 1 entree and 1 dessert.
Mizuna Salad (4/5): Great start to the meal, loved the crushed almonds/cheese on this salad
Calamari (4/5): Super refreshing! Not what you expect - the calamari is not deep fried and there's no breading (which makes it look naked) but it went great with celery and cauliflower. Healthy calamari option :)
Asparagus on savory panna cotta (5/5): I had never heard of a savory panna cotta before but that stuff comes from the Italian heavens. It's this amazing garlicky sauce that would make any vegetable your favorite.
Tagliatelle with ricotta and peas (5/5): Perfect pasta texture! The ricotta made the pasta interestingly sour but it really balanced out the cheesiness of this dish. Loved this creative pasta!
Risotto, mascarpone, mint (4/5): Would have preferred it if it weren't made with mixed grains (brown rice), but this felt like a healthy option!
Duck confit (5/5): ......THIS DUCK is why I will be returning to Vendemmia. Perfectly crisp skin on a melt-in-your-mouth duck leg, the best finely-mashed potatoes on the side, and the green
/ orange drizzle sauces made this dish top notch. I'd be hard pressed to find a more delicious duck.
Halibut (4/5): Nice crispy skin on this halibut too, but does not compare to the duck :)
Rhubarb panna cotta (5/5): If you like panna cotta, you will LOVE this jiggly wiggly panna cotta topped with oats.
Ricotta cake (5/5): My favorite dessert of the night - it looks like a cheese cake but it's not nearly as creamy/fatty/sweet. The cake itself is not sweet, but the raisins and almonds on the side made this dish so surprisingly great!
Tiramisu (5/5): It comes to your table as a deconstructed tiramisu cake, with pieces all over the place, which is pretty cool. Definitely one of the healthier tiramisu's I've had (seems to be a common thread among all their dishes) and I love that!
I'll be back, Vendemmia! And please have the duck confit on your rotating menu when I'm there!!","Vicky T.","$50 for a tasting menu?! What a steal! We were more than full after leaving Vendemmia last night. We had 12 courses. We started with, penn cove oysters, juicy heirloom tomatoes, garden cucumbers, the sweetest melons I've had in a long time and the most delicious fish crostini. We gobbled everything up! Then came the hamachi collar! OMG!! I literally sucked the bones clean I kid you not. We were given not 1 pasta dish, but 3! The server let us put in a preference of which of the 4 pastas we wanted. We opted for the agnolotti. All of the pastas were delicious! We finished with 2 different desserts, a chocolate dessert with a hint of coffee and a yummy almond cake with peach compote. My favs of the night were the heirloom tomatoes, melon appetizer, hamachi collar, fish crostini, the agnolotti and the almond cake dessert, basically everything was delicious!","Alexandra K.","this place is my favorite happy hour spot in seattle. the food selection is amazing, good indoor / outdoor seating options, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. i can't say enough about the beef tartare, it is an absolute must.","Jenny C.","Seattle Restaurant Week April 2018
Service: Bad. She forgot one of the 4 starters and we didn't realize this until after we paid and I snapped a photo of the menu for Yelp. Her response? ""Sorry, I wish you had told me earlier."" And that was it. Keeping track of the courses is her job, not mine. We put 2 cards down, she asked if we wanted to split it and she ran my card twice. Our server Anna basically did a crappy job.
Food:
Starters
1. Octopus--Octopus was so tender and the cauliflower had a nice crunch.
2. Asparagus--Missing
3. Mizuno salad--Felt very spring. It was a nice balance to the heavier pasta.
4. Tagliatelle--My favorite after the octopus. The pasta had fresh peas (a bit too firm) and a minty cream sauce.
Main
Halibut--Preparation could be better. One piece of halibut was nicely seared and the other had no sear on it at all so that nice crunchy top was missing. The fish itself was very tender but I could have used a bit more sauce.
Dessert
1. Ricotta cake--It was served warm!! Make sure to get this. It was so tender and we loved the grapes and almonds on top.
2. Panna Cotta--Skip. It was creamy and dense but the topping didn't do much for it. I would opt for the tiramisu instead. That looked better once i saw it.
I still think this place is a good deal for SRW but next time I'm going to watch the server closely to make sure I get everything that I paid for.","Jenn C.","We love coming to Vendemmia! Their simple spaghetti never disappoints. The pastas tend to be pretty al dente, which is my preference. The veggies and small plates that I've tried over time have always been good. I tried the beef tartare on my most recent trip and was very happy with it. Nice wine selection.
The only negative comment I have is that the tomato based meat pastas tend to be salty (aside from one or two staples, their pasta selection changes frequently, and there are usually one or two meat ones). Most recently, it was the beef shank paccheri that was borderline TOO salty. Everything was cooked well and the flavors/richness were good, but definitely very salty. My boyfriend agreed, and he even had a cold that was dulling his taste buds. Normally I would say this is a one-off, but I've had similar experiences in previous visits, one involving some type of a bolognese sauce. So, we always get one spaghetti to be safe :)
I haven't been here for Happy Hour yet (I attached a menu since I couldn't find one posted anywhere) but based on the prices it seems like a great deal to get some of their staples. Absolutely would be back to try the HH tartare, spaghetti, and a glass of wine :)","Marie B.","This is a two part Yelp belated post from a birthday celebration (6/9/15) and for Day 1 of Seattle Restaurant Week campaign (10/15/17). Both dinner visits were specifically with the intent of celebrating at Vendemmia.
The first visit was a culinary revelation along the retail and restaurant row on 34th Avenue in Seattle's Madrona neighborhood. Definitely something different from my visits at St. Clouds or Hi Spot Café. This uplifted my spirits since I was worn out juggling a new job and dealing with an ailing parent. As a cancer warrior, I treasure each birthday I get to celebrate. I recall the lovely atmosphere, impeccable service, and amazing food. It was a feast for the senses. I just located my digital photos and posted them this evening (11/15/17). Who knows where that digital camera went? Thank goodness I had transferred these photos to a file on my ancient laptop.
In the interim, I had enjoyed several visits to the late Contadino over on 19th E in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Still hadn't checked out East Anchor Seafood (Madrona) or Raccolto (West Seattle) though. I was saddened when Contadino had closed. I had made a mental note that I needed to revisit Vendemmia.
I had that opportunity a month ago (10/15/17) during the first day of the Seattle Restaurant Week (SRW) campaign. My sennin-so shiatsu LMP reminded me that I really needed to make the effort to take better care of myself and partake in fun activities of my choosing. Gave myself plenty of time to deal with traffic, found parking by Vendemmia, but had a tiny mocha first at a nearby indie café. Yes, it would have been more enjoyable to be with others, but this 6pm reservation was solo for the purpose of taking myself out on a 'date'. Life's too short to expect magic to happen, especially with my chaotic roller coaster called life.
I was seated at a two top by the entrance and host stand. I had a great view of the open kitchen, but was not distracted by the full restaurant and bar scene. I was really focused on each dish brought to my table. I was shocked that I was given all four of the starters. So rather than the expected three courses for SRW, I had experienced six!
The flavors (with a capitol F), textures, visual composition were incredible. I had to remind myself that I had to pace myself. I still ended up having to box up some of my starters (charred broccoli and chicory apple salad) but definitely the Hamachi crudo and pork loin with tonnato were devoured! Same fate happened with half of the herb stuffed porchetta with autumn squash and pickled chanterelles. Made for an amazing lunch the next day. I barely made it through the dessert selected, the baked budino, as I thought of the Monty Python reference of 'one thin mint'. Overindulged, but overall dining experience was phenomenal.
The cuisine and service were memorable that photos from 6/9/15 and my visit a month ago on 10/15/17 remain vivid. Vendemmia is definitely highly recommended!","Jo V.","Update: Still great service however celeriac soup tasted like corn starch, hubby's cavatelli was heavily salted, tagliatelle and green bean appetizer were great. $90 plus tip, ouch!
Next time in Seattle, will be seeking out another restaurant for Italian food.","Mike S.","We went to Vendemmia yesterday for my wife's birthday, she really liked the place as did her sister. Definitely has the look of a place women would like to go. ""Trendy"". I had a pasta dish with pork, which was pretty good. They have Rainier tall cans for $4, another good choice.
Overall everyone who went enjoyed the spot. The waitress was very helpful with suggesting cocktails and attendant with our table."
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Isaac H.","Spend an evening with Mike and you'll get one of Seattle's most uniquely cozy and fun dining experiences. He'll start by placing his big hands on your table and asking about your dietary restrictions, and then drop his signature, ""Are you ready for a beautiful dinner?""
And with that, the plates start coming. Things start slowly with salad and bread, then graduate to an array of dishes from eggplant to steak to mussels to cannelloni. I've experienced some variation in quantity, but proper planning for the 4-7 courses means foregoing the usual afternoon snack.
The food comes to just $35, though raspberry lemonade and dessert are hard to resist. Plan a full two hours. The pace and atmosphere will make you want to linger, and you don't want to miss any courses!","Prachi S.","01/31/2020 - update to my previous review.
Very disappointed with the service. Have had amazing experiences past 2 times which is why we went to celebrate my husband's birthday with a group of 7. Usually we have got atleast a 5+ course and a dessert. This time we got a penne pasta, ravioli, cheese garlic bread (which is note really a main course) .. post which the server thought we should've been done and offered dessert. BUT we were still hungry and expected more, so she just REPEATED the pasta dish. We finally asked if we could get some chicken/pesto mushroom pasta (atleast a diff sauce base)!!!!
Did not see the main Chef Mike (I believe that's his name) for whom we actually went there as he is amazing. Not sure if this place has become too commercial or was it just a busy Friday night. I would def avoid weekend nights since it didn't feel customized (for which this place was my favorite) at all.
Love the place. Chef is amazing!!!!!!
There is no menu. The chef talks to u and understands exactly what you would like and are in the mood to eat and goes above and beyond to make a special customized meal for you. Make sure you let me know of any allergies or dislikes befo.
Been there 2 times to celebrate special occasions and have had an amazing experience every time!!","Katie D.","WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY ENTIRE LIFE. I wish I could give this place 0 stars. My friend and I originally came here to buy a bottle of wine for her boyfriend because he said this resturant had it.
We were sat at a table and served wine before we could really get a word out and we weren't even ID'ed which I thought was strange. We had our IDs out and the owner gave us a weird look like we didnt need to show them to him.
The food kept coming and there were no menus. The meals are apparently ""customized"" but the dishes were what everyone else was getting as well. The food itself was terrible. We were getting nauseas after the 3rd course. I couldnt even identify some of the food. We finally asked one of the servers to box our next course because we wanted to just pay and leave. The owner also asked us if we wanted a refill of our wine and we said no. Five minutes later he pours us a second glass. We recieved dessert which was pretty basic but not nauseating.
Then the bill comes, it totaled about $110 for two people. Keep in mind there were no questions about what our budget was and no insight to how much these ""customized"" dishes cost. We were also charged for a full bottle of wine which we definitely did not consume. We were also charged an extra 10 dollars for desert...which we thought would be included in a 4-7 course meal. The owner came by and apologized for charging us for a full bottle of wine...and then told us to basically not TIP to make up for it.
So instead of just quickly refunding us and printing out a new ticket, he decided to screw over his servers who were definately pooling tip!
This place and its owner is a joke.","Leslie Q.","Came here for my and SO's anniversary dinner and had a rather disappointing meal. We were put on Pasta Freska (PF) by a co-worker of mine who lives in WA. We came on a Tuesday night, so it wasn't busy at all (maybe 2 other small parties besides us).
PF is located on the intersection of like three streets. We arrived at around 7PM and were seated right away. The gimmick with PF is that there really is no menu - the chef comes talk to you and finds your likes/dislikes/allergies and accommodates you depending on what you say.
For us, the chef or owner or whatever literally asked us, ""Ok what don't you like"". SO said seafood/spicy. Then he was off to the kitchen. When he came back, he slopped our first dish on each of our plates with no comment on what it was, or what the dish consisted of. Apparently we were just suppose to shut up and eat whatever it was. Next dish, same thing. I seriously had to stop him and ask wtf we were being served. I don't know if it was just an off night or if it was because the chef/owner's friends came by that night so he didn't give as much of a sht. But man, it really soured the experience for the both of us. For a restaurant with no menu, I was half-expecting the chef to describe what he was putting on our plates.
Luckily, another man, who was much nicer and conversational, helped us with answering our questions, getting us water, tea, and new plates (when ours were covered in previous dish's sauce). I liked that guy.
Anyways, all the food was really meh. I did enjoy the mussels and one (1) prawn tho. Everything else tasted phoned in/generic Italian/not impressive or stand-out. Without ordering any alcohol, our bill still came out to over $100. Wtf? Seemed overpriced for the tapas-style plates we received (refer to 8 pc tortellini and broccoli pics).","Mandie R.","I asked around with some local ladies for a fun place to bring my husband for his birthday, and this came up with the recommendation ""if you like something unusual and you like Italian, this is the place to go."" Sold.
We arrived for our 6pm reservation to find we were the only customers in the place (it was completely full when we left a little over an hour later) and were taken to a table by our very quick and quiet waiter whose name I never did catch. The building layout is very unusual, but it ended up being great because it really isolated sound and kept it from getting incredibly loud for such a small dining room.
Chef Mike came to say hi and check to see what we couldn't have (Shellfish for me, Spinach for my husband), and if we prefer our food spicier or more mild. He brought me a glass of a lovely red (many people mention bottles, we weren't offered one nor did we request one) that I'm guessing was a Syrah blend but honestly I couldn't tell you and I had an impossible time trying to get an answer as to what things were.
The salad was fine; lettuce, goat(?) cheese, tomato, zingy dressing. I wasn't really here for salad so no complaints.
Round 1 was an Eggplant dish, Round 2 was Spaghetti, Round 3 was unidentifiable-- my husband got a plate of maybe pork(?) in a red sauce with broccoli in a runny white sauce that mixed unappealingly with the other sauce; I got some manner of stuffed pasta with a Spinach sauce, Round 4 was 4 mussels and a prawn for my husband and a breaded fish in white sauce for me. Dessert was a little sampler of three items.
We both enjoyed Rounds 1 and 2, round 3 we both hated and barely touched, round 4 was okay.
All told even with a full dining room we didn't feel forgotten or rushed. We both left full and wanting to visit again, service was spot on, but I'm REALLY not thrilled that I couldn't get anyone to stop and tell me what I was eating/drinking and what was in it-- if we do go back I'm going to be a lot more pushy about it.
For two with a glass of wine we came in at about $95 before tip.","Ashley H.","Coming here was such a fun, delicious experience! I highly recommend this place! Once your seated you're met by friendly staff who pour you a great glass of wine to go with the food they're preparing for the evening. There is no menu, so staff will ask for your preferences and then get ready for a four or five course meal that has been created for the evening! They literally bring out your table's food straight from the skillet and place it on your plate. It's an amazing experience and everything was delicious!","John T.","This ones a bit difficult to write. Five of us ordered take-out/delivery from this place. I had chicken pesto, my wife had chicken alfredo, and the others ordered spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, and seafood risotto.
This experience wasn't all that bad, and my wife and I actually got lucky with our dishes. I loved loved loved my chicken pesto which was near perfect. It was so creamy and delicious and had pieces of zucchini inside that were amazing. My wife's chicken alfredo was also amazing. I couldn't stop eating hers. Both of our pasta noodles were perfectly cooked as well. Lastly, the garlic bread was soooooo delicious. Sooo much garlic I was in heaven.
Despite the above, we had to give 2 stars based on the service... nothing to do with the taste of the food. The spaghetti was ordered with no cheese due to a lactose issue. Unfortunately, it was covered with parmesan which made it inedible. The risotto unfortunately had no risotto. It was regular pasta... perhaps angel hair? Lastly, they failed to include any utensils or napkins.
It was too bad. If the orders were correct, this might've been a 4- or 5-star rating. And perhaps this was just a one time issue. Moreover, if you actually ate at the restaurant, you would've probably avoided this experience, in which case the food would've just been delicious.","Kristen K.","What an unexpected and wonderful experience!
In this unassuming, triangle-shaped restaurant located just off Westlake Avenue N, you will find a meal unlike any other.
At first, you walk into the restaurant and are greeted by the friendly staff. If you've been here before, it's likely that they'll remember you. The server -- Taylor, Marcelina, or possibly Ali, the son of Mike the owner (sorry if I've misspelled any of your names) -- won't bring you a menu. Instead, they'll ask you if you'd like anything to drink, about your dietary preferences, and if there is anything you can't / don't like to eat.
Then, the meal begins. They'll bring you a bottle of wine -- whatever they think you'll like. And then comes course after course of delicious perfection.
As my uncle put it, ""The worst part about coming here is that you eat something amazing and don't know what it is!""
This is what I remember:
- Two bottles of red wine
- Salad
- Garlic bread (so soft and perfectly toasted!)
- Breaded rockfish
- Mussels, clams, prawns
- Eggplant parmesan (definitely the winner tonight. So good.)
- Chicken thigh with goat cheese
- Spinach cannelloni stuffed with fish and shrimp
- Canneloni with chicken
- Pasta (they bring this straight out of the kitchen and serve it from a big pan)
- Four assorted desserts (Flan, spumoni ice cream, chocolate truffles with cherry sauce, and some sort of mango mousse sponge cake)
And that's just what I remember.
We were so full we practically rolled out of the restaurant. Then we all waddled straight to our beds in a deep food coma.
You may expect all of this to come at some insane price -- But all of this came out to just over $200 for the three of us (including tax, tip, and all that wine). Perfectly reasonable for what you get!
Basically, you will love Pasta Freska if you like the idea of:
- A family-owned restaurant with a casual, friendly, and intimate environment.
- A multiple-course gourmet meal with no menu.
- Exploring and sharing good food with good friends.
You may not like it if:
- You are a picky eater with specific dietary restrictions.
- You are a germaphobe and don't like sharing plates with other people.
- You need a menu and the feeling of control.
Otherwise, I totally recommend Pasta Freska to anyone and everyone looking for a true Seattle gem.","Diane S.","Got a to go order, and wasn't very impressed. The food was ok, nothing special but not bad. Just seems pricey for ok pasta. Service was great about getting us our food. Just wished their were either better portions or more exciting pasta.","Mia C.","Came here last night with my friend. I would rate as below:
Service: 4. All the staff were very nice and filed our water very quickly. It must be hard to keep track of all the tables though because things either came to the table a little too fast or came not quite hot. They fixed it by the 3rd course though, so all good there.
Food: 3 I liked all of the different dishes they brought out. Salad, bread, crab, eggplant Parmesan, and spaghetti. They all tasted okay but none blew my mind. The salad, bread, and the spaghetti were pretty much what you would get at any chain Italian restaurant, the eggplant Parmesan was a bit soggy and chewy. The crab was my favorite. Desserts were good. but seem like they were premade all at the beginning of the day.
Value: 2. For a bottle of wine and two dinners and a dessert, it was $128+tip and tax. The price of the wine, $44 is reasonable, but as someone who knows wine, the wine glasses are terrible and it's a small fix to get better wine glasses to get the full potential out of the wine. Dessert was an extra $9, which was not told to us. I would have liked the option to decide if I wanted to pay extra for dessert. So that leaves the actual dinner at $30 per person. With 5 small courses I would say the quality was not worth the $30 for what I would have paid $15/person for at Olive Garden or Buca di Beppo.
Don't think I'd come back with so many other great Italian places in Seattle like Artusi, Spinasse, Cuoco, etc.","Itzel S.","My husband suggested we try this restaurant after viewing the menu on Open Table and Yelp. When we got there and asked to see the menu, the waitress said ""we don't do that, you need to trust us."" After probing she provided a brief vague description of the process- Basically it's a Chef's Selection 5 course meal - then asked if we had any dietary restrictions. After expressing some concerns with the whole just trust us thing, she promised she would accommodate all of my restrictions.
We pressed on and decided to keep an open mind. We had to wait 15-20 minutes between courses. The food was average at best - oddly reminiscent of something you'd get from Chef Boyardee. Not to mention they serve it to you with ZERO description of what was just placed in front of you. I guess this is what they meant by ""just trust us.""
If that wasn't bad enough, over an hour in, while waiting for the third course, the chef/owner approaches us and asks that we could please get up and move because he'd forgotten about a large party that needed our table.
I personally feel that listing an itemized menu on places like Yelp and Open Table, when what they really offer is only a Chef's Selection menu, is misleading and confusing. Especially as a diabetic patron who needs to know what I'm about to consume in order to administer the right amount of insulin. (PSA: If you have any kind of dietary restrictions, please avoid this place at all costs)
Needless to say, we will not be returning to this establishment. The service was poor, the mystery ""meh"" portions were small and the entire experience was frustrating and confusing. If you're looking for subpar Italian food and mediocre service go to The Olive Garden - at least there, you know what you're signing up for.","Sagar K.","SO I will have to leave a relatively short review for a good reason you'll know after you visit the restaurant. This is a great, unique little family owned restaurant and everything is cooked to perfection. If you're in Seattle, and looking for a unique dining experience, don't look anywhere else. The Horri family puts their heart in this restaurant and you feel it the moment you walk in, must visit!","jill g.","I have been coming here for almost 20 years, how have I not written a yelp review? This place is nothing short of darling and you are practically guaranteed to have a great experience. The main thing you need to know: no menus. You read that right, there are no menus. Mike, the owner and chef and sweetheart of a human being will come to your table and see what you don't eat. One person doesn't want shellfish? No problem. One person is a vegetarian? No worries. One person doesn't like any kind of seafood or spicy or long pasta or mushrooms? No worries. Mike has you covered. Once that convo has happened, all you need to do at that point is sit back and relax and wait for plate after plate of food to be delivered to you. There will be an appetizer. There will be a salad. And there will be other foods that will blow your mind. And without exaggeration, in the hundred or so times I have eaten here I've never had the same meal twice.
And do not forget to leave room for dessert! Flan, tiramisu, cheesecake, ice cream, cannoli - True to form you never know what you are going to get but it's going to be amazing.
Evening parking directly across the street is plentiful and free. But you might want to walk for a few miles to burn off all of the food you just ate :-)","Jeremy S.","I've been going to Pasta Freska since 10 years ago and it hasn't really changed much. The decor is very similar if not the same and food tastes like homemade Italian food.
Pasta Freska is a great place to go to when you don't want to think about a menu instead of wanting to go somewhere you can socialize with some friends or a date. I wont describe too much of the experience because many Yelp reviewers already have.
I just have a few notes to make: one time I made reservations via their website. When I was there with a date, a server came up to us and I told them we had reservations. He responded with ""Really, are you sure?"" as if he couldn't find us. It was weird because I even had text proof that it was booked. He then said ""hold on one second"" and left. It wasn't until someone else came (I think the owner) that he asked how many we had again and sat us. It was kind of a weird situation.
Then last night, I went there with 3 of my friends who booked via Open Table and we got there at 6:30pm. There was at least 15 people in the front waiting and the host said they were running late and backed up. He didn't check or write anything down. So we got the feeling that we wouldn't be able to get our seats and after waiting a while, we left. The funny thing is, I used Open Table to find some other time tables elsewhere and Pasta Freska was listed with an open table at 7 pm, 7:15 pm. 7:30 pm, etc. which was clearly not going to happen... So I would suggest that you don't trust the reservations here and be prepared to wait. Otherwise come right when they open or on weekdays.","Marie B.","I didn't want to go out to dinner, why? Still stuffed from earlier meals on the road. But a family member was so insistent because it's my birthday.
Drove from Shoreline all the way to Westlake via 99/Dexter. Arrived at 1850 for 1900 reservations. All crammed at front entrance with no one recognizing our presence.
Chef shows up handing out wine to placate the masses. I pass...I did a wine tasting across the sound, I'm good. Ate some amazing food earlier from a Ligurian chef/owner. Really I'm good. You ever see someone ""in the weeds""? The entire BOH/FOH. Totally.
30 minutes. Zilch. Nada. Walked out back in the rain. I did call and left voicemail that we left.
I'm sure it would go unnoticed.
Just saying, but resisted saying I told you so.","Jenny D.","This was such an epic experience for my daughter and I. The food was incredible but please note... SAVE YOUR BREAD for the delicious sauces that come with every dish. Omg sooo good!!! We did not and regretted that every second of the meal. We had reservations for 5:30 and when we left we passed the huge crowd waiting to get in. Bye Felicia! Did I mention... soooo good","Upasna D.","Went with my girlfriend for dinner. Chef comes and asks your likes and dislikes and makes you dishes of his choice. It was a five course meal. Chef was friendly and service was excellent. Food was average.","Maria T.","Great food and overall great experience :) Chef Mike is funny and engaging. I love not knowing what dish is going to be served next! I brought my family who are visiting from the Philippines and they loved every dish! We had requested for spicy pasta which was delicious and truly spicy! We will definitely be back!","Kay N.","Definitely a fan of this place!
I went here on a Thursday with a party of four. It wasn't that busy and we asked to sit on their roof patio. It was so pretty, a scene from Europe! It had flowers blooming with real grape vines growing.
I didn't know this walking in but this place apparently doesn't have any menus. Our server asked us if we want some wine and any allergies or things we don't want to eat.
We said yes to the wine and no on allergies and then we were on our way to a delicious journey. First came out warm garlic bread and a salad which I enjoyed. The following dishes were a little bit of a blur, they just keep coming out! I think our favorites was this crab pasta and a tomato based linguini. Overall, all the dishes were really good. I believed I tried 4-5 dishes. It is served family style as the server has this huge plate of food and they walk around plating everyone's plates with a piece of it.
The dining experience is a little long, we were there for over 2 hours but the servers were pretty attentive.
I was curious of what the price was when we got our bill and it wasn't too bad! We also had a Groupon too.
I would definitely return. It's a fun and relaxing experience and you don't feel rushed here.","Mary Jo F.","We had dinner here last night outside on the patio!
This restaurant is charming and unique and the staff is amazing! A GEM hiding in West Lake!!!
No menus - so be prepared to be surprised by every delicious bite! It's very hard to describe! Salads to all, first course the same to each of us... from there until dessert, individual courses that we just had to share! Wines chosen by the waiter, the owner's son! Amazing and delicious! Sorry I didn't take any pictures! Next time for sure!"
"Montalcino Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/montalcino-ristorante-italiano-issaquah?osq=Italian+Food","Mark H.","I've been coming to this restaurant for about 10 years. The food is always excellent and the service is good. Great hidden gem in Issaquah. Love the atmosphere and the Italian singer is a nice touch. I saw the new owner go from table to table to make sure everyone was satisfied. He even came to open the door for us as we were leaving and sincerely thanks us for coming in. Our server was excellent as well.
We highly recommend and will return again soon.","Kishi M.","I. First Impressions/Backstory: Came to this place many months ago and was turned away because didn't have reservations. Called this place last week and spoke to someone who set up a table for 2, which was very nice. Came to the place and sat down, one of the waitress came to us and 'roared'.. 'Do You have reservations ?'. Felt odd to be welcomed that way - told her the name of the person I spoke to and Thank God she went away and WASN'T our waitress. The rest of the evening went well...
II. Overall: Cozy Ambience and Decent Food
III. The Food: Had heard a lot about this restaurant being the authentic Italian experience in Issaquah and so came to see for ourselves.. we ordered:
- Osso Bucco: Done well with the Bone Marrow intactt. Subtle Taste and mildly flavored. Nothing popped for me in terms of taste
- Penne Pasta: This was done very well. The balance between sauce and the flavors was good, not to mention the pasta itself done very well
- Home Made Tiramisu: Good Taste, softly flavored
IV. Service and Ambience:
- Service: Our waitress was super nice, very attentive and the exact opposite of the waitress who we had the misfortune of speaking to earlier and spoke like it was an inquisition.
- Ambience: This is a small cozy joint in downtown Issaquah. Thru the extent of the entire night Tony was on the Guitar and kept singing various Italian and other songs. He was very gracious, came to our table and took our request - made a big difference towards the overall dinner experience
V. Price Point: Average price of an entre is around $25 with highest priced item closed to $40 as well as a stellar collection of wines and more. There are better places that serve better Italian food and less expensive though..","Tim O.","The best dining experience in the Puget Sound region is in Issaquah. The food was amazing. The staff were amazing. The owner spoke with each guest and was available continuously. I could lavish about the Marsala Short Rob Ravioli or the masterpiece of a Sampler Platter but the experience is what I am most effected by.
You will need reservations. Because of this, you will notice most of the dining room will be seated within a short timeframe. You'll hear other conversations and soon wine and appetizers flow through the room. The air fills with laughter and warmth and then the entrees start to come out. The food is celebrated as it's delivered to each table and neighboring tables are showing each other the incredible presentation of each bowl or plate.
All along every need is anticipated and each guest feels invited. We can't wait to go back!","Huong L.","I heard of this place for a while and since it was on SRW, I figured it would be a good opportunity to check it out. The place is a little out of main Issaquah but it's nice cause you can find parking better.
When you walk in, you get greeted by the owner himself who checks on if you have reservations or not. Once you get seated, the waiter comes out to give you your menu to look at.
We got:
Gnocchi - super yummy, soft and the sauce was delicious.
Wild boar pappardelle - the pasta was a little over done for me but the sauce was delicious. You actually get pieces of wild boar. The plate itself was simple but it was delicious.
Canolli - the cream was to die for. The canolli itself was a little soft because it was dipped in chocolate. I wish it wasn't dipped in chocolate but it was still good.
We also got a Caesar salad from the regular menu and it was good as well. The complimentary bread was probably one of the highlights, it was soft and really good flavoring.
The only thing: they asked if we wanted distilled water or sparkling water. We chose sparkling but didn't realize it cost us $4.50 for the bottle. I wish they told us in the beginning.
Besides that, everything was good and I'm definitely happy that there's a good Italian restaurant in Issaquah","Gloria K.","Such a wonderful experience! My boyfriend and his family came here for his birthday dinner from a recommendation. The service here is top notch and I had one of the best services from the waitress here. We had a table of 7 people and the waitress brought our appetizer in two separate plates without us even asking so that it's easier for all of us to share. She was also very patient in answering our questions as we're not familiar with italian food.
Everything we ordered was amazing! Everyones number one favorite dish was the lobster pasts (they don't skimp on the seafood). Everyone elses second favorite was the meatball pasta, although my second was the seafood pasts. The meatballs were gigantic and had so much flavor! It was filled with a lot of vegetables and etc. The seafood pasta was a pink sauce, also very flavorful and filled with lots of seafood!
At the end of our meal the waitress brought out a bright hat and a glass of moscato for everyone (on the house) along with the guitarist singing happy birthday to us in italian.
This is the perfect place if you want to enjoy authentic tasty italian food with the best service. The restaurant is small which makes your experience more intimate. Thank you Montalicino Ristorante Italiano for your amazing food and service!","Ivy L.","Solid 4.5 stars for this restaurant! It was a cozy intimate atmosphere with the red brick walls and the candlelight.. we had a party of 6 and they sat us in the ""mafia room"" which was a semi-private room on the back with the wine.. we didn't mind it one bit. It made our bday dinner a bit more private. The owners introduced themselves to us and they are so charming and sweet. They were so friendly that you can't help but immediately love them. The husband and wife team just recently took over the restaurant and it looks like they're doing something right cause the food is amazing.
We were greeted with some sparkling wine while we waited for our table to clear. We had reservations and the people were just finishing up when we arrived. No big deal since the restaurant is a bit on the smaller side. We were seated and started with the antipasto - wow what a plate! They charge you per person on this, which is why we had so much food! There were meats and cheeses, bruschetta, tomatoes and bufala mozzarella, giant shrimps, olives, etc. It was a lot, to the point where I wish we had less cause I didn't want to ruin my appetite for all the delicious pastas! The antipasto was delicious though and they packed it up for us to-go!
Pasta dishes, we sort of went family styled and chose a few dishes to share! We ordered:
*both salads - the Caesar and the mixed greens.. both were good. Nothing to complain about here.. though they were on the smaller side so a bit more difficult to share a good portion.
*Short Rib Ravioli - yum! The pasta had a good bite and cooked perfectly al dente. I always look for this in a pasta cause it's so hard to find. The short rib was fall off the fork tender and the flavors were phenomenal. Do yourself a favor and get this dish! 5/5
*Gnocchi came with a selection of a few sauces. We went for the sausage cream sauce. Again gnocchi were cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious! I think one of my favorite dishes all night! 5/5
*Wild Boar Pappardelle - pappardelle is one of my favorite types of noodles! Good bite and perfectly cooked once again. Sauce was good but the other two won my vote for the night 4/5
*Pasta with Lobster in a Saffron Sauce - I think this was my least favorite dish of the night but that doesn't mean it wasn't good. It was fine, just underwhelming compared to its competitors. The lobster was lost in the dish and I felt like the flavors could be brought out more. I loved the seafood pastas in Italy, especially with the rockfish and lobster - cause omg seafood in Italy.. but the flavors of this dish didn't hit the mark. I felt like it had potential though cause I love a good saffron cream sauce! 3/5
*Homemade Cannoli, Pistachio Gelato and Tiramisu - the desserts were good but didn't blow me away! The cannoli tasted like it should. The Tiramisu needed less cream and more lady finger and espresso?! I wanted more of that kick and intense coffee and cocoa flavors. The pistachio gelato was my favorite dessert of the night. I think the dessert game could be amped up a bit, especially with the amazing pasta dishes!
Overall, I loved the food and ambiance here and have been recommending it to all my friends! Do yourself a favor and give this place a try, but remember to make reservations in advance cause it's small! Great for date nights and special occasions as well!","Caroline R.","11.30.2019 | Celebrated my daughter, Carleigh's 21st birthday at this fanciful Italian restaurant. Voted Best Restaurant, Eastside in 2019's Best of Western Washington. They were also featured in Evening Magazine! Best Italian restaurant indeed! Remarkable ambience! Impeccable food! They were all seriously bursting with flavor. Got to meet the owners/Chef, Reisa and Rick, and we were serenaded the whole night by Tony. We will definitely be back!!","Margaret C.","Enjoyed dinner at Montalcino last night to celebrate my birthday. The meal was exquisite, the service was impeccable. Rick and Riesa Ragan have hit this one out of the park. Don't miss having the best meal of a lifetime! Can't wait to go back! Thank you Montalcino team!","Michelle L.","Fantastic experience celebrating my parents' 32nd anniversary. The service was superb. The offered complementary champagne, cheese and even sprinkled the table with red rose petals. The food omg! Everything was magnificent. The seafood pappardelle was my personal favorite but honestly you can't go wrong. We also ordered their house bottle of wine which was fantastic. We'll definitely be back! It's a small place so def make reservations. When we went there was also an Italian singer and guitarist moving from table to table.","Inge J.","Fantastic little Italian place in downtown Issaquah. Surprisingly authentic which is very rare; most ""Italian"" restaurants serve Americanized crap like ""chicken carbonara"" or ""pasta alfredo"". Had a very nice Barolo with the meal, which consisted of a house salad, lobster ravioli, and Osso buco. The lobster ravioli with a whole lobster tail was nothing short of phenomenal. Perfect balance of flavors and textures. The osso buco was equally top notch with the veal falling off the bone, super tender and flavorful. Also came with nice tomato based sauce and veggies. The after dinner grappa was on the house; nice touch.
Throughout the dinner the waitresses and manager were super friendly and attentive. There was a musician who entertained with Italian and other nice music.
I was there by myself but can see that this would be a very good place for a romantic dinner also.","Upasna D.","Very intimate ambience! I reserved the table in advance on a weekday for my husband's birthday. We ordered two vegetarian entrees- pasta al pesto fungi and pasta Gorgonzola. Both the dishes were delicious. For dessert we ordered tiramisu and coffee. Tiramisu was okay. Overall, a good place for date night or special occasion.","n B.","Second visit and the food was even better this time! Highly recommend! It is small with a intimate atmosphere.","Andrea P.","Montalcino is NOT the Montalcino that we loved before it was sold recently. We invited a couple of clients after raving about our 'favorite' Italian restaurant on the Eastside and told the waitress this was a client dinner. She immediately promoted their Barbera wine special without telling us the price and bringing out a taste and saying, ""You absolutely must try this wine!"". And because we didn't wish to look cheap we did not ask for the price and ordered a bottle, and ultimately two more glasses in which they gave one pour in one glass and only a half a pour in the 2nd because it still had 1/2 glass remaining. When the bill arrived we were charged over $60 for the bottle on 'special' and $34 for the 1 1/2 pours!
Then we ordered some of Mama's homemade cheese for an appetizer, something we always ordered in the past because we had been introduced to the previous owner's mother while she was actually making the cheese. The previous owners are neighbors of our very good friends. This is when we not only were told the restaurant had been sold, but that supposedly Momma never made the cheese! So we knew this was a bold faced lie! The cheese plate arrived and there were only 4 minute slices of cheese, barely a bite per person, when in the past it was plenty for four people!
The food was decent, but not the excellent fare we had come to expect from Montalcino, and that went for us and our non-Italian clients. Understand my family is Italian, eat fantastic Italian food at home nearly 3 days per week, we just returned from several weeks in Italy taking cooking classes in various regions, and have sampled nearly every Italian restaurant in Seattle and the Eastside.
And when we were ready to order desert we were told that we only had 10 minutes left of our allotted time on our reservation. Another first as we often had spent more time eating dinner there. It felt somewhat like eating at cafeteria.
Then the bill arrived. Including wine, appetizers, and main courses, no dessert of course, for four people, $498.95. Plus tip this felt like a lot for what we received, and were used to receiving in the past.
Big disappointment!","Riz Q.","Had a reservation for 8:30 but the party who's table we would be taking ended up staying longer than anticipated. The 4 of us were perfectly content standing in the hostess area listening to the sweet man playing guitar and singing. Fernando (who is the owner) personally greets everyone and he was extremely apologetic that we weren't being seated right away since we had a reservation and brought us all a glass of Prosecco which was completely unexpected and appreciated.
After being seated, we were immediately greeted and asked how our night was going. Immediately felt welcome to be sitting in her section and never felt differently. We chatted a bit and decided on the meat and cheese platter to start with a bottle of wine. Incredible flavors and they all worked so well together.
Split two entrees and we ate family style and had the Misto Mare and the 4 cheese Risotto Italiano Trio with added Italian sausage. Both dishes were extremely tasty and the balance of flavors made me want more and more.
The night will be a fond memory for the rest of our lives as the entire experience was impeccable. Cant wait to go back!","Molinda K.","Great 5 star restaurant in my books with amazing food and great service. I really like the ambiance of this restaurant from the second we sat ourselves for our reservation at 7:30pm we were asked if we wanted our jackets hung. We ordered a couple bottles of wine, the lobster ravioli and the lamb were the crowd pleaser of the night. Would recommend this place to anyone!","Paul J.","Riesa and Rick have maintained that special feeling at Montalcino. My wife and I celebrated our 29th anniversary and the service, food and ambiance was fabulous.
Service is top notch the specials will not disappoint. The lobster ravioli is amazing.
Thank you Lucy for the attention you gave us Sat night. It made for a special night.
You may catch the guitar players who come work the room as well from time to time....a nice touch.","Michael C.","I took my wife for a date night to Montalcino restaurant. It could not have been better! It's a cozy, intimate environment that is not pretentious or overdone. My wife had the veal ossobucco and I had gnocchi with a Gorgonzola cream sauce. They were both out of this world. I highly recommend this place.","Steve G.","Been visiting Issaquah for years and somehow never dined at this jewel. Better reserve as they appear to be a popular destination and now I know why. Our server Mia was incredible with great recommendations and frankly you couldn't go wrong with this incredible menu and variety of outstanding flavors ! Would rate this 6 stars if I could! Nice atmosphere and dishes to die for! Now that I found it in downtown Issaquah it's my ""go to"" list of destinations for incredible Italian cuisine!
Thanks for serving such amazing food with presentations that have you staring for a while before digging in ! magnificent !","Emily L.","Came for husband's birthday dinner, the waitress remembered the occasion and wished my husband a happy birthday as soon as we sat down. We loved the prawn and scallops appetizer, the sauce was amazing! I can't help dipping it with the bread.. the pasta were rich and creamy, definitely enough portion for dinner. We also ordered the bomba ice cream for desert which was refreshing and yummy!
I liked the small intimate space and live music! The guy sang us a birthday & love song which my husband enjoyed very much! I would definitely recommend and come back to try out other dishes!","Seatown S.","Wonderful restaurant. However the waitress was really inappropriate, fawning and flirting with the men in our group. It made the night awkward and took away from the birthday celebrations for everyone, especially me. I won't likely r"
"Cafe Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michael G.","3.5 stars would be most accurate, but this place deserves the benefit of the doubt for 4 stars. The food is very good, and they use very fresh high quality ingredients. Pizzas are awesome and the salads are well constructed for superior flavor. An exception is their meatballs that left a lot to be desired. They were very small, dried out, and lacking in flavor. I also would prefer they use veal and/or beef, and not the added pork in the meatballs, as not everyone can eat that. Another challenge is that although the food is generally very good, their menu is extremely limited with not so many options. I wish they would add more fish and clams, or Italian style tenderized chicken/veal dishes.
It is definitely expensive. I recall some of the pasta dishes were around $24 a plate, yet they were also extremely delicious. I also really appreciate that they offer complimentary bread and olive oil, as well as delicious olives served at the bar. That makes the higher prices more worth it.
The atmosphere is excellent, and the service was pretty strong making the high prices more worth it. My only complaint on service is they served pizzas excatly at the same time with pasta dishes instead of phasing them, and it was too challenging to eat everything before items started getting cold. That was a big service miss.
When they have live music they definitely elevate to at least 4 stars!","Jordan L.","The vibe of this place is SO cute! My boyfriend and I wanted Italian food last night so we decided to try this place out. We made a reservation but weren't actually seated for around 10-15 mins, which was a little irritating but that's alright.
Once we sat; however, the service was fast. We got our food really quickly and someone was there to take our order almost immediately when we sat down. I got the small lasagna (I wasn't that hungry) and it was really yummy! I wished I had gotten the bigger one because it was delicious. My boyfriend got the gnocchi and I also loved that. I don't even usually like gnocchi, but the sauce that it was served it was just great. Both were pretty pricey however, and while the food quality was good, I still think it was a bit pricey.
Our server was really nice and got our order in pretty quickly, but other than that we didn't see her much. She was really busy though, and being a server myself I understand, and wasn't very bothered by that.
Overall, this place is really good and you probably won't be disappointed if you try it out. For me, it just didn't blow me out of the water with food or service like some places I've tried, so I feel 4 stars is a fair rating.","Kyra D.","Genuinely one of the best plates of pasta I've ever had. They made me fettuccine with vodka sauce and it was perfect. My friend got a pizza and she also thought it was great. The vibe is cozy, the neighborhood is so pretty and cute. We sat right at the window and we loved our time here. The service was quick and the staff were very nice. I will be dreaming about my pasta forever.","Merlyn R.","This was our first meal in Seattle, and I can't say there was any disappointment. There was a fancier atmosphere (we were a bit underdressed) with a nice interior, white table clothes, and excellent service. The food was fresh and delicious. They catered very nicely to a dairy allergy as you can see in the picture (half cheese / half no cheese). This was a little more expensive than expected, however, you're paying for the experience as well as freshly made Italian food! One pizza can feed two making it more affordable.","Tammy Y.","Delicious authentic Italian food, made with simple ingredients that leave a hearty impression! Valentine's day dinner here was such a delight. I have driven past here countless times and have even walked all the way home from this area before. For some reason I didn't realize there was a gem sitting in plain sight the whole time! Not sure where the less than 5-star ratings are coming from because this restaurant is absolutely lovely.
For a completely full house for 3.5 hours straight the service was good and I didn't feel rushed at any point during the meal. When I saw the queue of 10+ people waiting at the door I realized why it seemed that the servers were rushing around - and did the responsible thing (quickly cleared out!)
The table bread was very fresh - best table bread in the city! And we loved the pomodoro appetizer. Goat cheese and tomatoes juxtaposed by crunchy toasted crostini was pure perfection. The gnocchi melted in my mouth and was so satisfying that I only needed to eat half of the entree - the other half I finished for lunch the next day! The vegetarian lasagna was simple, delicate, and wholesome. Words cannot describe the best lasagna I have ever had IN MY LIFE.
My only complaint was that the aisles in the restaurant were a little cramped in certain areas and on a busy night this was a bit chaotic. Not a deterrent for me however - I can't wait to return!","Greg M.","I have not been here for a year or so. Six of us had dinner on a Sunday night. We were seating at 6:30 and things got really busy as the place filled up. Service was pretty poor- had to ask for bread to be brought to the table, took a long time to take our orders, and we waited at least 1/2 hour before our main dishes arrived. Service is usually really good here, so I'm assuming they were either understaffed or there were issues with the kitchen being backed up. Whatever reason, very disappointing for a place that has been around this long and should be firing on all cylinders.
As always, the lasagna is the best you can find anywhere. They have nailed this recipe for years, and it is always perfect. Very labor intensive to make it this well, and it shows. 5 stars.
Tried the gnocchi in vodka tomato cream sauce. Really excellent. An upper end Italian restaurant should not have gnocchi on the menu unless they know it will be perfect. This was as good as the best gnocchi I've had in Rome. Super light, great texture, flavorful sauce. As good as it gets.
Smoked beet salad, while not traditional, was excellent. Just the right amount of smoke flavor, well balanced vinaigrette that hit against the smokiness just perfectly.
Contorni of wood oven roasted carrots was the only real miss. Not cooked nearly long enough, they were served with a steak knife for cutting. The texture was not that far from raw carrots, and they needed at least 5 or 10 more minutes in the oven to help with the texture. Pretty flavorless and very disappointing.
To be honest, I was taken out for this meal and for that reason really enjoyed it, but if I had been picking up the tab I would have felt differently. Great Italian food in restaurants is understandably expensive- it is all about top quality ingredients and a kitchen that can execute without overdoing it. For the most part, Cafe Lago is still pulling this off, but this was not a slam dunk. If I go back I'll be sure to get the lasagna, which never disappoints.","Melissa R.","Here's what to expect when dining here:
For the price you pay, you get your money's worth without feeling over stuffed. Serving size is just the right amount of food, even if you order an appetizer plus a main course. Seasoning is on point and the sauces are flavorful. Simple yet delicious at the same time.
The service is prompt and the flow of delivery (beverages and food) is surprisingly steady. Remember to smile and thank your host(ess) and servers.
Recommendations: Use Open Table or call ahead to make reservations. Missed out on eating here a couple times because tables were booked up.","Marie B.","The last time I ate at Cafe Lago , definitely it was during the pre Yelp days and Alex (aka The Homie) was still toddler/preschooler aged, the Crayola crayon set.
I was dealing with a very aggressive tail gater on I-5 S, so I ended up taking the 520 exit towards Montlake. So it became an obvious choice to get acquainted with Cafe Lago's legendary lasagna.
We lucked out being seated immediately as a two top in the far corner. Menus, water, and delicious bread with evoo was brought to the table shortly thereafter.
Despite getting views of fresh pizza dough being tossed and thrown in the air, The Homie selected the fresh, handmade Fettucine with Meatballs ($24).
Like him, no starter apps or salads for me. Dive right in to main pasta entrees.
I ordered the large legendary Lasagne ($22) , because I still have fond memories of those thin sheets layered with bechamel and ricotta.
Both dishes have copious and flavorful house marinara. The kind that a second batch of bread is meant to sop up it all up.
I lamented the careless dribble on my sweater. That's what fabric stain remover is for! I ate half of this lasagne to save room for dessert. I'm going to have an amazing lunch tomorrow!
Hurray for desserts! The Homie selected the Lemon Tart ($8)...paraphrasing his description of having a limoncello atop a shortbread cookie crust. Luscious lemon custard!
The biscotti (and Vin Santo) sounded great, but my inner chocophile ordered the Chocolate Truffle Cake ($8) topped with a espresso creme anglaise. Reminded me of chocolate decadence from my pastry/restaurant industry days. Mmmm without it being over the top. Goldilocks just right!
Definitely, I'd lose the powdered sugar showering of each dessert though. Thankfully no token mint leaf in sight either!
Patting my 'food baby' belly as we walked back to the car....Alex asks, ""Mom, can we visit Cafe Lago again?"" Of course, was my reply.
Next time, with a much shorter interval. So glad that Cafe Lago has been going strong since 1990!","Mikayla J.","The bread and olive oil is to die for, i honestly wish i could buy a bottle. The pasta tastes fresh but not gummy. Service is amazing even when they are full, have never disliked any waiter there. Steak is very delicious but i think they may have a new chef who is still learning because the last time it tasted different and took a while but our server was extremely helpful and gave us free drinks due to the wait! My favourite place in seattle.","Mike S.","I have driven by this place for 20+ years and never gone inside! I used to go to the Montlake Alehouse next door, but that is no longer around. There was four of us on a Saturday night in March. The service was fast and the drinks and food came out quick. Nothing too complicated. The salads were basic, but people definitely ate them up. Pizzas are a huge part of the menu, so I ordered a sausage pizza.
I asked if they composted and the waitress said they did.
Good draft beer.
A warm, friendly environment.","Stephanie T.","Homey spot for quality Italian food. The bread was a great combination of fluffy and chewy. Split the artichoke salad and the fettuccine with meatballs, which was a good amount of food for 2. Artichoke salad had lots of crunchy snap peas and texture but not a lot of flavor. Went for the meatballs because we saw praise for them online- they were tasty, not life-changing. We were pleasantly surprised by the quick and attentive service- they even brought out both the salad and the pasta split in two separate plates for us. 5 stars for service, 3 stars for food.","Brooke B.","I really really like Cafe Lago. The food is solid and it has a very good comfortable casually nice atmosphere. It may not be the most creative menu but I've been to places that sacrifice flavor for unique so, I'm ok with that. Their homemade bread is amazing! My husband and I like to go here when we just want a quiet night with good food.","Alecia S.","Solid restaurant with fresh pasta. Went here for a bday dinner for a party of 4. Easy place to get reservations when a lot of the other Italian restaurants in the city is almost impossible for a Saturday night. Easy parking. Quick and delightful service. I had lasagna and my boyfriend had the gnocchi, which were both good but not the best so more like 4 stars for me.","Dainty P.","I have to admit, I would never come here except my Airbnb is closed by and I definitely didn't ordered the right stuff. I had mixed salad - okay. Nothing special and I was craving steak. It came in a lump of burnt and slight over cooked on the outside. The insides was soft and delicious but most of the steak was chewy and hard to swallow. Disappointed. And the steak cost $30. Uff. Not coming back.","Ashley F.","We love this neighborhood gem. Fantastic pasta and pizza (thin crust) and tasty antipasto. Trust us- we lived next to Flour + Water in SF and dare I say this is better pizza. Our service was perfect- friendly and helpful. Very kid friendly too, so bring the family!","Michelle W.","Disappointing. The delay on food was over an hour and 10 minutes!!! The wait staff knew and was alarmed but nothing was done to offer us another glass of wine or even apologize. Once the food finally arrived the quality was good. But we didn't expect to sit with nothing for an hour in between the salad and main. Wow.","Lilly A.","Amazing I love this place. As an Italian food addict there are few Italian places that really stand out. Cafe lago has great lasagna and homemade fettuccini!! Super flavorful and definitely far from bland-- truly Italian done right. Also their cocktails are great too!","Keith G.","Unlike most restaurants, they don't charge for their tasty homemade bread and olive oil. Something that always irks my mom, a former NPR food commentator.
Appetizers (tapenade with Eggplant, tomatoes, and something else) and rabbit liver pate which my parents liked were good. Handmade white pizza with Chantrelles was good. Main entrees with venison (good) but overly cheesy lasanga (where's the beef?) and clams on a bed of spaghetti were adequate.
They earned back points for dessert.
Verdict: come back for dessert only or go to Vendemia in Madronna. Plenty of free street parking.","Annie R.","Cafe Lago is delicious, but pretty expensive. $20-35 for each entree, and like $5 min for any non-alcoholic drink, is a little more than average but it's really good. Have come here plenty of times for birthdays or other celebrations since most dinners are min of $100. They hand make everything, I recommend their linguini with meatballs and definitely their Pomodori.","CA F.","Tried this restaurant on Friday night and it's so cute and quaint and quite the little neighborhood place. Had reservations at 5:45pm and by 6:15pm, the place was packed. The pizza was terrific. Had better gnocchi (it was good but the sauce was really thick). Husband liked his pasta dish with the meatballs. We had a very nice server; however, he could have been a little more attentive. When he did check on us, he was very professional and helpful. Will return for Pizza and salad -- can't wait!"
"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joel C.","Our experience at Bisato was amazing!! We were a four top and shared all plates. The Burrata was on of the most beautiful dishes I've ever seen. But then came the gnocchi, the yolk ravioli, and the ragu--Each so beautifully crafted, plated, and served. The flavors of these dishes were both familiar and completely new in the way they were prepared. I couLd not have told you what I was eating keg, but each item--each component--was so delicious and perfect together.
The service was impeccable. Just impeccable.
We started With the salumi. Ridiculously thinly sliced and delicious. We ate way too much focaccia b/c it was delicious and B/c the olive oil was the best we've had.
We cannot wait to go again!!!","J Y.","Loved our experience at Bisato! Yes it is small portion but every dish was prepared perfectly. Really liked their creative touch on pasta (both tuna and uni) and the bass was also cooked just about right (arguably the best in seattle). The service was very good!
Would like to come back soon.","Deane S.","This has to be one of the finest restaurants in Seattle. Each course was perfectly executed. The ingredients married perfectly and were exquisitely plated. We had our server pair wines with each course and he nailed it!
The service was impeccable and enjoyable!
Put Bisato at the top of your next restaurant to try list!","Alice W.","It's hard for me to rate this place bc we maybe ordered wrong... everything we got was incredibly heavy or creamy that halfway through 2 (of 4) of us had to stop eating and let our counterparts finish the meal and we had to cancel a part of our orders.
We partook in:
- Salumi: incredibly delicious and beautifully, thinly cut. probably my fave of the evening.
- octopus: the octopus and the accompanying ice cream thing were delicious but I wasn't a fan of the hot pepper paste that came w it. Reminded me of Korean gochujang (hot paste) and there was a bit too much of it.
- foie gras: I had to ask for extra bread to eat this since this stuff is pretty fatty/greasy. Standard foie gras. I liked the sauce that came w it. Good balance.
- scallops (3): this was also quite Easy to eat and share since the scallops were pretty large in size
- savory fish tart w 3 minute egg and salmon roe: this was a bit too much for me and we got 2 to share amongst 4 people. If we could've done it again, we would've only gotten 1 to share bc this is super heavy, rich, and creamy. This was yummy tho for the first 2 bites but I had to stop after that.
- Dungeness crab: probably the lightest dish we had. Came w shredded crab meat in a pretty little tower of thinly sliced honey crisp Apple. Perhaps the best paired dish we got bc everything before and after was super heavy.
- gnocchi: the gnocchi is actually pretty large in size. Only comes out as 1 gnocchi but it can be shared. Again, this came w the hot paste that was reminiscent of Korean hot paste...
- tagliarini noodles: this was a bit of a let down. It comes w saffron noodles I think, lemon grass, and uni. We were told by our server to have it mixed, but I wish we didn't mix it. The lemongrass was overpowering and you couldn't taste the uni at all. Also, throughout the rest of the evening at dinner and home, we burped lemongrass.
Hand pasta: this is a wide, thin piece of pasta. It was super salty. Thankfully this came out w the veal chop which was not very seasoned, so eaten together they balanced each other out. But overall a bit of a let down.
- veal chop: this came out wo any accompaniments, so it was literally just a plate of sliced veal and the bone. Not salty enough, so pairing it w something salty or a veggie is a good choice.
Hmmm.... I think the food was okay, but either too seasoned or not seasoned enough.
Also, our server advised us to get 3-4 dishes per person, which I definitely think was too much. I think that would've made more sense if we were guided to get a well-balanced meal w light elements and rich elements, but we were not informed on what would be super heavy vs. what would pair well together. Everything we got was super heavy so it ended up being a hard meal for us to eat, plus we ended up canceling a portion of our orders bc it got so heavy halfway through. They didn't have a tasting menu when we went bc they said they were ""in between"" a transition or something.
The ambiance is lovely though, the coat check is great, and the open concept of the kitchen is cool. Def a cute date spot or place to grab a drink, but I wish they helped us balance our meal better w suggestions, which I'm pretty used to at other restaurants esp at this price point.","Christy K.","This is a late review, as I went for a dinner back in early August. It was for our anniversary celebration, just the two if us. We went on a recommendation from a friend. It was an amazing experience. The service was one of the best I've had in a long while. Attentive, very polite and respectful, and not intrusive at all. They answered all questions and helped us decide on a perfectly delicious wine. They were quite concerned because a light bulb above us kept flickering. They offered to move us, but we hadn't noticed it at all so decided it wasn't necessary.
We had just recently decided on becoming pescatarian, and there were plenty of delicious options for us. We tried 7 dishes, as I had done my research. In many reviews people had complained that the dishes were too small and they had left hungry. So I decided to order plenty. And we ordered more than enough as we both left very content, almost too full. Each dish, as you can see in the photos, was a work of art! Almost too good to eat! The service staff were very kind and explained each dish. I loved each one. Enjoyed all the flavors, and we didn't leave any leftovers. I can't remember which were my favorites as it has been too many months since my visit. But I remember that the whole experience was excellent. We left happy and very impressed. I HIGHLY recommend this place.","Hyozzang C.","Best service, delicious food and beautiful kitchen. Loved all aspects of it. Cute for date nights, business meetings or friends night out. Highly recommend and would rank this restaurant as one of my top 5 in Seattle. Will definitely come back.","Jason P.","Never got to try the original Bisato before it closed in 2012, but now that it reopened again, I so glad I got to try out the restaurant. Its an other amazing fine dining addition to the Seattle food scene, definitely not for everyone, but for those that are looking for a extra special meal for a celebration this is a great choice for it.
The location of Bisato is in a darkish corner of pioneer square with street parking available, if hard to get on a busy night. Walking inside, its an amazing space, it modern and inviting, not the standard industrial like space of most Seattle restaurant. There is a bar area that doesn't currently serve food, as well as table seating for what looks like 50 people. There is a great bright open kitchen that they invite you to look into, but the rest of the restaurant is fairly dark.
I went the tasting menu, though was very tempted by the chef choice option for an unknown price. The highlight of the meal for me was ravilolo filled with ricotta and a egg yolk, seems simple but everything about it was perfect. The chef even came by to serve it and cut the ravilolo to let the egg yolk spill out. Definitely a lick the plate kind of dish. Everything was very inventive, never would imagine a combination of crab and apples, or a scallop carpacio with salami. The dishes on the small side, even the a la carte option, so you are going to be spending quite a bit, but it totally worth it for me.
The service was great, they constantly was checking in on me, the water was always refilled, and the described all of the dishes well. The chef was always walking around and interacting with the guest, had a really cool conversation with him.","Naomi B.","This is a poem to food. Every bitE comes with love and care and so much thought. It was a lovely experience from walking in the door to the last bite of dessert.","Ang A.","This place is amazing! My new favorite Italian in Seattle. I had the ravioli and it was to die for!","Scott E.","BISATO RE-OPENS IN PIONEER SQUARE
As a long time Seattleite I was fortune enough to dine at Chef Scott Carsberg's Lampreia and the original Bisato at 1st Avenue & Battery in Belltown numerous times; both world class restaurants! I am really excited that Bisato has re-opened in Pioneer Square (84 Yesler Way)!
The interior is warm and inviting with an open kitchen to watch the chef at work! And what a sight as you watch the kitchen staff work over an array of beautiful cured meats on the counter separating the restaurant from the kitchen. It opened in February and I have eaten there numerous times. Anything that the chef prepares is going to be an event. He adds new items to the menu on an almost daily basis, but also has some of his classics from his previous restaurants. And the service is world class!
It will be great for the neighborhood, but I think it will also be a destination restaurant for those seeking world-class cuisine!
Great to have you back Chef!!!!!","Drew S.","Several hours after enjoying a great meal at Bisato tonight, I just now realized what makes this new restaurant one of the most unique & interesting fine dining experiences in the PNW: it's a rare mélange of old school charm & attentive service mixed with some of the most modern, creative dishes I've seen/devoured in a long time.
The staff preparing and serving these artistic dishes are obviously very serious about what they do; but you can tell they also find joy in the collaborative effort.
We ordered about 12 dishes off the menu tonight, and all were fantastic. The real standout for me was the fish - in this case Bass served with Pistachio nuts and some fancy raisins.
A nice glass of Chianti and some crazy good chocolate tart helped seal the deal.
I can't wait to come back and try everything else!","Kate C.","Absolutely amazing experience. The service was done with precision, from the moment we stepped in the door. The attention to detail in every aspect of the decor, utensils, glassware was a wonderful compliment to show off the amazing dishes.
We enjoyed several items Chef Carsberg had on the menu (soft opening): hamachi crudo, radicchio salad, gnocchi, truffles pasta sheet, short rib, chocolate mousse and a surprise extra dessert (ice milk with chocolate soup).
I am still dreaming of the short rib, hamachi, both pasta dishes and the desserts.
Seattle is lucky to have Chef Carsberg back, leading a very talented team. I can't wait to come back after the official opening!","Bennett L.","The food and service were wonderful. We tried the ""Cook for Me Carsberg"" omakase-style dinner, which came out to around $200 per person for nine courses. We felt that this was a great way to sample everything that the restaurant and chef had to offer, and we were blown away by the creativity exhibited in the dishes, as well as the exquisite and choreographed service. However, the dinner was very seafood-heavy, so we would not recommend for those with an aversion - although I'm not sure if this is intentional, or if it changes around the year. They are also very accommodating when it comes to dietary restrictions, so perhaps seafood allergies would have resulted in an entirely different meal.
The dining space felt very modern, and the open kitchen design allowed for guests to see their food being prepared - a nice touch. The restaurant itself isn't large by any means, but this resulted in a more personal atmosphere, and it was clear from the arrangement of the kitchen to the display of open and constantly-shifting beverages on central tables that this is meant to evoke a feeling of being at a dinner party.
Chef Carsberg stopped by our table several times over the course of the meal to check on how we were enjoying things, and even allowed us to enter the open kitchen afterwards for a quick conversation and picture with him, also making a point to ask for feedback on the dinner. Thus, a great meal culminated in an even more memorable experience.","Asasia C.","Great new restaurant! My husband and I randomly decided to stop in and give it a try. My husband had the tasting menu and I opted for a la carte. I appreciated that the whole table did not have to participate in the tasting menu. We enjoyed every dish. Some highlights included the wagyu beef special, dungeness crab with apple, and the gnocchi, and meat ragu with purées potato. The chocolate mousse with orange confit was also delicious. Service was great - attentive but not overbearing. We will definitely return soon!","John R.","We brought two out of town guests (Tucson and Chicago) to Bisato last night - the former Trattoria Mitchelli location, but the interior improvements are nothing like the old TM. A beautiful space, with the open kitchen divided from the main dining area by a counter filled with beautiful cured meats. The service, from start to finish, was impeccable. I liked our server's style, but at times his desire to inform us felt a little pushy. I am not a fan of being told ""you should order.."", but it was low key. I also found it a little confusing to have so many off-menu items that he explained, but they got a bit lost in the lively atmosphere. This is a ""hard surface"" space, so my personal hearing issues can result in me losing a lot of the detail from a soft-spoken server.
Service of the food was top notch. All plates were set simultaneously and without any mix-up in who ordered what. Likewise, finished plates were quietly whisked away when we were done.
Food quality was amazing. Everything was perfectly prepared, artful presentations, original flavor combinations and a treat for palette and eye. We had a lot of fun sharing small tastes with each other. Portions are reasonable, maybe running small for big eaters, but Bisato is not about the volume of food one can consume. We tried the bass, steak and marinated black cod and everyone loved their food. The ""hit"" was the gnocchi - a nice fat dumpling topped, atop and aside many other creative ingredients and flavor pairings. The other hit for me was the asparagus soup - a bowlful of the taste of spring!
For us, having a fine dining establishment in Pioneer Square as an alternative to Il Terrazzo is wonderful. We can walk there from our office and we plan on entertaining more clients and business contacts soon. I am pretty sure Chicago and Tucson will know about this restaurant as our business contacts are sure to talk it up. The dress, by the way, is Seattle casual - no pretense here.","Christina G.","AMAZING! I think this is my favorite Restaraunt in Seattle! The staff is personable, the chef is so polite he comes to see how you're meal is, they truly take care of you.","Brooke J.","Exceptional service, romantic ambiance, delicious food, incredible wine selection, and a creative chef. What more could one need? This place is like a hidden gem. One of the best dining experiences I've had in Seattle. I can't wait to return.","Melissa W.","My husband and I had dinner at Bisato a few weeks ago and the experience was one of the best of my life. Not only was the food fantastic, fresh, perfectly prepared, but not overly garnished, but the service was impeccable. The staff treated us so well I thought they might have got us mixed up with a food critic that was supposed to come in the same night. They were attentive without being over bearing and did a wonderful job with meal and wine suggestions. I can't wait to go back and bring friends!","Jerod P.","This is probably my favorite new restaurant in town. I had the tasting menu and each item was fantastic. The chef does a great job of coming up with creative, complex, dishes that are presented well and taste great. Looking forward to going there again.","Jayme G.","Bisato is my jam! I had the chance to dine at Bisato several years ago in the old location and fell in love with it then. So I was really excited when I learned that it was coming back. Actually, I was worried that it might not live up to what I remembered. But having been a couple of times now in the new location I can say it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The new space is gorgeous. The service is refreshingly great (somehow low key but still exceptionally informed and attentive). And the food always astounds, which is not at all a surprise as the chef is never not there. This is my new favorite Seattle restaurant.
I've been really fortunate to have traveled extensively for work in Europe and Bisato always strikes me as one of the most authentically European dining experiences I've ever had in the US bar none. It's hard to explain but there is a tradition of respect for ingredients and food that is so apparent in the food here. It's interesting though to look through the reviews and to see a few who just don't get it. Which doesn't really surprise me because this guy is cooking as if his life depended on it and most people aren't used to that. It's like he's using a whole different language of cooking. This chef is old school but manages to make the food surprising and new at the same time.
This food is about ingredients and flavor, not about heaping, torso-sized American portions. It seems to assume that after you've had several bites of something your taste buds acclimate to those flavors and it doesn't surprise anymore. So why not finish it up and move on to the next thing that is going to dazzle you?! I've never left Bisato hungry so I don't understand some of the smack talk here. If you leave this place hungry then you're doing it wrong. Order more food! You won't be sorry. There is not a better value in restaurant dining in Seattle - no - America....than having this guy cook for you! We'll be going back often."
"Il Fornaio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Oksana N.","Went to anniversary date with my husband. This is a wonderful place. Great service and food!","S M.","The F#*kt#rds at Yelp still refuse to remove this restaurant (or at least label it ""CLOSED"") even though it went out of business and closed it's doors 8 months ago......it's mind boggling.
See farewell letter from Facebook in attached picture","Tiffany S.","I've had happy hour here twice and I've ate from their regular menu twice. I feel like they serve a very quality meal but I think portion size is a bit small for the price even though I know it's great quality but I feel like portion size could be a touch bigger. Service has always been good and again the food is always been delicious.","Amanda L.","Stopped in for lunch after work. Food was delicious and staff was friendly. The ravioli was taken off the menu which was one of the best dish there but everything else was still good. Unlimited bread which is a plus for us. I do think the price is a bit high from what I would expect and some dishes, the portion didn't quite make up for the price. But everyone in the group cleaned their plate so I can't complain there.","Jerry N.","Very disappointing. We were in Seattle for over night and my wife noticed this place and said she thought they were top notch, high end Italian chain with great reputation.
WRONG!
the pricing was there but not the options or the flavor.
a bunch of weird dishes.
nothing normal Italian at all
my shrimp risotto had little tiny bay shrimp (almost as small as a can) in it.
my wife's pasta was to have a garlic wine sauce............but came with a red sauce.
not impressed","Matt C.","Great expectations. We have been to the Beverly Hills location and had very high expectations coming here. We walked in and waited at the Host Stand. Three employees, one of them a manager, walked up to the station, looked at a paper, turned and walked away. NOT ONE PERSON said hello or even made eye contact.
The waiter was more like a part timer. She was friendly, but was paying more attention to something else.
The food was mediocre at best. Not bad enough to complain about, but certainly not even close to Beverly Hills. The saving grace was the complimentary bread - it was Great.
The waiter realized that we got the short end of the service and brought us a complimentary dessert - which was wonderful but it was too late.
Il Fornaio has a great reputation - like I said the Beverly Hills location is AWESOME. But here in Seattle it was very disappointing and they charge the same prices.","Jessica S.","I was pleasantly surprised by Il Fornaio, in terms of service and food options. My significant other and I came here for an early dinner and I was bit hesitant to try the place out, only because it's located in a mall. With that being said, it really is a great spot to wine and dine.
My partner and I ordered a pasta and pizza dish, so that we could both try each. I had the spinach ravioli, he had the pork sauce based pizza - the exact name is escaping me at the moment. Regardless, holy-moly they were so good! Great flavor for both entrees and we spoiled ourselves with dessert.
Our servers were very knowledgeable of wine pairings, as well as suggestion entree food options. I love leaving a restaurant feeling spoiled and well taken care of and that is exactly what I can say about this place.","Ryan S.","Food: 6/10
Service: 4/10
Atmosphere: 6/10
Il Fornaio in Seattle is, unfortunately, pretty forgettable. It's possibly a touch above Maggiano's or Carrabba's, but there's not a lot to say about this location. They seem to be somewhat stuck between authenticity and Americanized Italian, and ultimately fall between the cracks as a result. I would think that, being so close to an oceanic coast and having so much fresh seafood available, the restaurant should focus on highlighting the advantages of its location (understanding that it is a small chain). Service was inattentive and could easily have sold my group some appetizers, but seemed more interested in watching the bread cook and gossip, so we didn't indulge.","Jennifer S.","Restaurant is beautiful. Staff is very helpful, professional and attentive. I was not surprised by the prices, however, I was surprised by the food. The entrees had by my husband and myself were so bland. That coupled with the crazy price tag was a huge disappointment. They did have an amazing dessert which we enjoyed. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this restaurant, nor do I plan on going back.","L W.","Made a reservation for 8 and the host asked me if it was a special occasion. I told him that it was a ""why yes it was, my in-laws 50th wedding anniversary"" When we arrived I reminded the host that it was a 50th wedding anniversary. They walked past the center table set for 8 and stuck us in a corner next to the kitchen. (That other table was finally filled with 6 people about an hour later). I think they looked at our mixed race family (white, black and Hispanic) and judged us that we shouldn't be in the center of their nice space. Another AA couple was stuck in a corner.
The waiter was nice but didn't say happy anniversary or talk to my in-laws at all even though I told him that we were celebrating such a big event. The host did not seem like he was making it special as I hoped the waiter would.
After we ordered appetizers, drinks and dinner (they forgot my steak knife and made my husband get up to finally get me one because my butter knife wouldn't cut it-I happily tried) the waiter asked if we wanted dessert. I said yes and he brought me a menu. I finally asked, do you do anything for ""special occasions because you guys asked me if it was and marked it on our reservation?"" He said 'oh yeah. We could give you a spamoni gelato ' ok. So I ordered a few more desserts so we could all share some.
Not once did this restaurant make our special occasion special. I told the young, dumb and broke host that his table choice was rude. We might not look like we are well off or tip well but we DO and even if we didn't it's their integrity in their service, (btw-I tipped 20% because it was work to serve 8 people and I'm not rude). Also my medium rare steak was not red at all in the center. I didn't want to dampen the night. I will be calling the manager but I doubt he/she cares. We shall see if they even respond on Yelp.
Update : the manager doesn't seem to care that we came for a 50th wedding anniversary nor that they asked but treated us like we should be sat by the kitchen and not treated kindly or like the special occasion that it was. My in-laws are the kindest people. Too bad no response. Changed from 2 to 1 star 2/5/19 after no response from the manager.","Sara N.","I really enjoyed my meal at Fornaio! A huge part due to the fact that our waiter was really kind and personable from the moment we walked in. For example, he offered to put parmesan on our pizza and checked in on us the right amount. The wine I had was really delicious and the pizza was good. I'm not giving the full five just because the food we had wasn't spectacular, but the service was so great that I would definitely come again!!","Catherine L.","horrible service shitty food
How does one order delivery for a pizza with a salad and only gets the salad !!???? Had to wait 1 hour for my cold ass shitty pizza .... when they live 5 blocks away??!! Ridiculous
The only good thing is they returned my money for just the pizza because they know they weren't going to get away with this .","Trisha F.","I once turned down a date here because I was like, ""Uh, a mall restaurant? Gross."" My loss, because now I've finally eaten here I realize not all mall restaurants are created equal.
We came in on the late side for dinner, and our server was very nice and flexible with our annoying orders and additions--lactose intolerance, type 2 diabetes, just a lot of special dietary needs.
Ended up trying the cucumber cooler cocktail, Margherita pizza, Caesar salad, meat ravioli, and goat cheese flatbread appetizer. Family got the white chicken rigatoni pasta and the seafood sampler dish, which came with two kinds of fish, shrimp, calamari, and a veggie side. The dishes are expensive--more than 20 a pop so it adds up fast, but they were relatively good. I say I'd probably skip the ravioli next time. The pasta was too firm and there weren't enough to warrant 22.50 price tag. Since every main is about the same price, I feel like even the white chicken pasta bowl was a better deal.
The flatbread was good. Crisp and topped with tomatoes and red onion. Cucumber cocktail was weak. The best looking dish was the fish sampler. Pizza is typical Neapolitan, so soggy/soft and wasn't the best leftovers. Their bread and oil/vinegar is delicious--the bread has a great crust and the inside is so tender...it's delicious and wonderful for sopping up extra sauces from your main.
Overall I was happy with dinner and I'd come back to try other food and have wine over cocktails.","Roy L.","I walked in to a dining room that was more than half empty on a Friday evening at 7pm (which was the first warning sign) and was told there would be a ten minute wait. Why? Unacceptable. No reason to turn down business when there are plenty of empty tables. I looked at the dining room, then looked at him like he was nuts - but he offered no explanation. Perhaps the host did me a favor by letting me walk out, without any offer to stay not even for drink at the bar. I honestly wouldn't mind a wait under 15 minutes, but there was no justification for this. I have never wrote a review without tasting food first, but will do so whenever I receive piss poor, uncaring service like this, especially without even sitting down.","Sharon G.","We were very impressed by this restaurant during our visit there yesterday.
We had a sleeping child in a stroller and were looking for somewhere we could take the stroller, unfolded, inside. They were completely understanding on this point and seated us in quiet corner with our stroller.
My butternut squash ravioli with fried sage leaves was excellent. The dish featured large, soft, homemade pillows of pasta and there was a circle of very fresh tomato sauce in the middle. They kept the fried sage leaves out of the sauce so that they were crispy and easily paired with a bite of ravioli. I especially loved that touch.
My husband's Tagliatelle Bolognese was very good as well.
Lastly, we were very impressed by the kindness of the staff. We would definitely make another visit in the future.","Jesena M.","We've been here twice so far, it is close to Paramount and we park in the same building anyway. I'd love to give them a 3.5*, but I feel 3 is too low and they are not quite a 4.
We both had pasta and pizza both times, I wasn't too impressed with the pizza the last time, this time around was better. We both really enjoyed their pasta dishes (Penne vodka and butternut squash with brown butter and sage). We also decided to order an appetizer salad plate, which was nice, but could have used a little more something. It was plain lettuce with some parmesan shavings, I think a couple of tomatos, olives and other items could have added to it. The salad was too simple for the price we paid.
Service is always slow, we got seated and someone brought us water, another person a basket of bread and than no one else came for about 15-20min at least? We didn't know who our waiter was, so we emptied the bread basket and were just about done once the waiter showed up. He seemed stressed, even though there wasn't too much going on yet when we arrived.
Overall a decent option, but it isn't the high end italian experience I was hoping for.","Doris W.","I have been to this location a few times now with my aunt and uncle and I have actually been to the one in Coronado in San Diego. I have always had good experiences.
The first time we went to this location, we sat at the bar section and had happy hour. Which for food, is a pretty good of $6 apps and pizzas.
Went here again last night and dined in their dining room right next to the dessert cart!
We ordered:
- squid ink pasta with salmon, shrimp, clams, and mussels $23
- risotto
- calamari
- mixed charcuterie board
The squid ink pasta was pretty good! It was my first time trying squid ink pasta and I really enjoyed it. the sauce was light and their was plenty of seafood in the dish.
With a Yelp check-in you get a free order of calamari! Score! Overall, we had a good time.","Jamie W.","Stopped in for lunch, wasn't busy but food was great. Had the pizza, minestrone, and seafood appetizer. Waitress was very attentive and seafood was fresh. The pizza was perfectly thin and had a great cheese to sauce ratio. Would love to stop back by for pasta.","Arthur A.","Exploding tomatoes, Imported pasta, and brilliant italian minds providing a cerebral flavor overdrive. Tastes so hardcore, speed noming behaviors were grounded into a fine halt and dragged for a meticulously hour long flavor marathon. My grinding machines set to slowpoke to insure every biting sequence was celebrated for cerebral satisfaction. Il Fornaio concocted such a masterpiece, my food resume set a new record for slowest meal eaten.","Cassie J.","Run - do not walk - away. This place has turned into a complete dump! The food is ridiculously overpriced for what it is trying to pander to tourists. And the flavor was ""Meh.""
The restaurant is worn. Walking upstairs to use the bathroom I noticed a terrible stench coming from the carpeted stairs that have clearly never been cleaned.
Bench seats and repairs with duct tape. Slivers abound with the worn tables. And they no long validate parking.
It's a dump. Don't bother."
"Carmine’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carmines-bellevue-2?osq=Italian+Food","Katy C.","After visiting Carmines in Downtown Bellevue again for my birthday I can say that it is truly one of the best dining experiences in the Seattle area.
The service is always friendly and welcoming, professional but not pretentious. They always greet with a smile and take your coats to hold while you dine. The servers think of every detail, are very knowledgeable, and truly want you to enjoy your experience.
Their food is incredible. I always get the fennel sausage pasta with a vodka cream sauce, I have a hard time ordering anything else! I started with the charred romaine salad which is also very tasty. The crispy pancetta on top is a nice touch.
My husband tried the crab risotto special and I don't think I've ever seen him enjoy and savor any other food ever!
They even gift you a biscotti when you leave to continue enjoying your meal the next day with your morning coffee
If you're looking for a spot for your next celebration, date night, or if you just want to feel a little fancy, Carmine's is the spot!","Helene L.","Food- very good Italian food. Portions are modest to fair, will fill you to content unless you order an additional salad , side or dessert. The bread is amazing crusty outside soft inside ciabatta from Central Market Seattle (per bus boy). I got the cioppino northwest, which was piping out with yummy seafood tomato broth. The gulf shrimp were huge and white fish buttery. Husband got the white clams linguini, which was delicious, wish it had more pasta, but we asked for 2nds on bread to sop up the yummy sauce. Rigatoni Bolognese is classic and nothing to rave or complain about, I would order it again as comfort food. The insalata di mista was seriously just greens, no tomatoes, cucumbers or additions. They will substitute the dressing to a lemon vinaigrette which was solid.
Service- very good!! Attentive servers who I feel like are real Italian. Server kindly split out salad order and kids order to 2 plates.
Ambiance- I categorize as upscale rustic Italian, with the chandeliers, white table cloth, exposed beam ceilings. Beautiful entry way flowers and landscaping decorations. They have nice velvet booths and large chairs. Great for a date, celebration to celebrate, not ideal for rambunctious kids. Goes well with the Italian theme, and the restaurant name itself.
Location- across from downtown park. Street parking.
Value- fair, you pay for the whole package, of service and ambiance.
Recommend- yes.","Joelle L.","MUST GET THE STEAK. I know they're an italian restaurant and you may feel the need to get their pasta... but i'm telling you this place should become a fancy steakhouse because their steak is damn good. I had 3 of the pasta dishes this night and all of them combined did not live up to expectations and flavour. But I highly highly recommend the steak. I think you get the point.
Also, one of THE best dining experiences here in terms of fancy restaurants regarding service and atmosphere ! So that's a plus plus plus!","Ali L.","Carmine's is a beautiful restaurant for a date night! The atmosphere is incredible and the service is always wonderful. Prices can be high, but if you go with a vegetarian option and get drinks elsewhere, it can definitely be an affordable date. I always get the fettuccini al pesto without prawns. Although parking can be tricky, and it does tend to get crowded in the evenings, the food is definitely worth it.
I highly recommend choosing Carmine's next time you are looking for an upscale restaurant to grab a bite.","Shari A.","One of the best fine Italian restaurant in the region. Nice selection of delicious dishes. Everything from pasta to Salmon was good. Of couse, they have a fabulous wine list. A little expensive but worth it.","Yc T.","Made a reservation thru open table and requested a quiet table for boyfriends birthday.
We arrived and the table had a happy birthday card welcoming us. Wait staff was attentive. Made our selections on dinners and it was served in a timely manner and it was still piping hot. Veal scallopini was delicious with caper sauce. Halibut was tasty as well. Also ordered the fettuccine gluten free and it was very tasty with great texture and flavor. Squid ink seafood was awesome with a little bite of heat. All and all a great place for food and very classy.
We were even presented with free birthday dessert to finish off our meal.
Our waiter Brett was awesome too. Humorous, patient and engaging. We will return for more great food and good service.
Upon exiting the restaurant we were giving biscottis to take home wrapped up pretty.","Nina S.","Worth the $$$! Great service, great food!
This place gets packed so highly recommend making reservation.
At a friend's recommendation, we went here for my birthday. Love the small details they do -- a handwritten happy birthday note card on our table and the staff's ""happy birthday"" greetings as they walk past our table.
For starters we had:
Calamari Fritti Fried squid with spicy marinara and lemon aioli, topped with fresno peppers $16
Bruschetta Trio: Black pepper, goat cheese, and tapenade Avocado, smoked salmon, and Crème Fraiche $21
The calamari fritti was crunchy and seasoned well. It was not oily at all. The Bruschetta was delicious as well. I recommend these 2 starters.
I had the Zuppa Del Giorno - Daily special seasonal soup $12 - which was seafood chowder. Yumm! Ingredients were fresh and very tasty!
For Main we had:
One of the day's special: Asparagus risotto with fried soft shell crabs. 2 pieces of nicely deep fried whole soft shell crabs on top of asparagus risotto.
Squid ink Capellini Di Mare Angel hair pasta tossed with fresh tomatoes, prawns, mussels, calamari and Manila clams Lg $28 Sm $21 -- the large size is good for sharing.
Costata Di Maiale - Double cut bone-in Pork chop with apple-pancetta chutney and risotto. $39
All three main were very good and I recommend all of them. The surprise was how good the pork chop was! It was juicy and tender. Very tasty!
For dessert we had tiramisu and gelato.
The staff were great -- very attentive. It's what you'd expect from a fine dining place but with a more relaxed atmosphere.","Kunal G.","Carmine's in Bellevue is one of the more popular Italian restaurants in the area. Definitely helps to get a reservation in advance unless you sit at the bar top. The food is great - high quality ingredients and simple, while still flavorful. I liked the Gnocchi more than the Bolognese which I got last time. Both are food, but this Gnocchi was really good! Only knock on the place was the service at the bar... not as warm and welcoming compared to being at a table.","Dana D.","Oh my goodness! One of the best pasta dishes I've ever had... I'm lactose intolerant but this did not hurt my stomach.","Rhonda H.","A marvelous cozy New York style Italian eatery with a lovely bar and fantastic help and every dish we tried was better than the next. I recommend Carmine's to any visitor to Washington even if you have to drive it was worth every penny even though it was way more than that! the meat dishes were so tender in your mouth, the bread was crisp, the pasta was as good as it gets! The gnocchi melted in your mouth in soft pillowy bites! The wine menu was outstanding and the dessert was great! What more can Say? GO","Tingting W.","Oh my goodness. I don't even know where to start. This is literally my favorite restaurant in Bellevue!! It is located in old main, very cute and calm area. I posted 2 photos of the chicken entree that my boyfriend and I always get. Those pics were taken two different times, and as you can see, they switch up the veggies!!
My go to is the pesto fettuccine and the rigatoni bolognese. I always get the large size which is around $25!! I can't say enough good things about this place. The vibe at the restaurant is fancier than most. And the wine is good too!!","Rose W.","Want delicious Italian food, elegant ambience and patrons dressing up for dinner? Then look no further than Carmine's in Bellevue.
I came here on a Friday night with a group of women to celebrate a birthday and we all dressed up. Reservations definitely needed as it was completely full.
had the complimentary bread, Caesar salad for an appetizer, risotto for my main and tiramisu for dessert. Every item tasted fresh and cooked beautifully.
We had fantastic service and felt it was a perfect restaurant to celebrate a special occasion. It's definitely pricey so I'll come here again for another special occasion.
You can park on the street or at Downtown Bellevue Park or pay for the valet service.","Chang L.","Taste- *****

Carmine's is my favorite Italian restaurant on the eastside. Great food, great ambiance, and amazing service. This is a great place for date night and to celebrate special occasions. It's a little pricey, but 100% worth it. Will return time and time again.","Sarah M.","Each bite of the brown sage gnocchi was so good! I would definitely recommend having this dish if visiting. One large dish is the perfect amount and will leave you feeling satisfied and sad that there's no more once finished.","Song K.","The Service really makes up for anything at this establishment.
Best service ever!
Everyone that helped us (I counted about 5 people randomly attending us without care of section or status) were so detail oriented and helpful! They even did a ""Split and Marry"" with our selection of food as well since we were sharers.
The food was above average but nothing fantastic was my take away for quality of food. The price was to be expected and average for fine dining.
The atmosphere and architecture setup of the restaurant was on point to deliver the feel of quality without compromising a warm welcoming feeling. I felt comfortable and very accommodating. I have been to many places where I felt like I didn't fit in or the staff would look down on me for being a muggle in a fancy place. I never felt like that at this amazing dining experience! It felt like going to a chef's home in which you were good old friends.
Really, service was over and beyond amazing. I obviously can't say this enough. Thank you!","Flora C.","I really like the Carmine's set up and operation. The atmosphere is great, the service is above average. The food from pasta to seafood to steaks are always on the point. I had dinners and lunches here on different occasions. My favorite dish is the squid ink pasta and desserts. My family enjoys the warm bread ad butter every time.
The only two things I wish...
-Dinner time is very noisy no matter it is weekdays or weekend. It is hard to talk at my own table. I prefer to come on the weekday for a late lunch.
-I wish to have the squid ink pasta not the angle hair style. I want a thicker texture than the thin hair.
Otherwise, this will be my rare 5 stars review in Bellevue, Wa.","Heather M.","I can't wait to go back!
The evening started off a little rough since we weren't able to get in at our 8:30pm res time, but we got to sit in the entry and watch all the interactions. You can tell that everyone in this restaurant truly cares about what they do, know their stuff, and want to ensure each guest feels special and taken care of.
Once we were seated, they sent over a comp app for our extended wait - and it was delicious. Our server made sure any requests we had were taken of, and we really felt cared for. The food was absolutely delicious - from the app to the entree to the dessert!","Joel Y.","We had an excellent dinner at Carmine's. The decor was nice, parking was easy to find (surprisingly), service was great, ambience was excellent (we sat outside where it had sort of a Parisian cafe feel).
I ordered the Fettucine al Pesto con Gamberoni and my friend had the Squid Ink Pasta. Both were delicious especially the prawns that came with it.
The price also wasn't too bad for an upscale Italian restaurant. Two entrees and two cocktails came out to $100 after a 20% tip.","Landyn R.","Ambiance is superb and the service was above expectations, i found my spaghetti a little bland though. Overall great experience w/a killer cosmo!","Upasna D.","Top notch service!!! Came to this restaurant with my girlfriend! We both are vegetarian and had decent options on the menu! We started off with burrata and soup. I had the cauliflower soup and my gf had tomato soup! Both the soups were creamy and delicious. For main course we ordered a gnocchi in marinara sauce and angel hair pasta in sage butter. Both the pastas were good. We finished our meal with tiramisu, Panna cotta and some coffee! Everything was perfect and as mentioned earlier service is outstanding!"
"Andare Kitchen & Bar","https://www.yelp.com/biz/andare-kitchen-and-bar-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Sean B.","Came here because it was raining hard and we were staying at the Hyatt. Gotta say we were pleasantly surprised. Wife loved her cocktail, and we both really enjoyed the carne pizza. It was excellent. If you want a light dinner, one pizza for two people is a good choice.
We also shared a chocolate mousse for dessert. It was pretty good, but a bit too heavy for my wife. I, the chocolate fiend, was very happy with it.","Sara A.","I was pleasantly surprised by Andaré. It is one of the restaurants in the Hyatt Regency and is reasonably priced for the quality of food. I tried the Trofie pasta and the grilled salmon. I was a big fan of the pasta which was made with a pesto sauce based with pistachio. I would recommend this for the pesto lovers out there. Unfortunately the salmon was not impressive. It was a bit over cooked and didn't taste very fresh. The bread service ($3) comes with a decently sized warm load and olive oil/vinegar.
Andare is the more casual one restaurant if the hotel on the first/lobby floor. This being said it does have a nice ambiance and is more casual nice than casual, but most people are dressed very casually.","Christine W.","Absolutely outstanding! Ken was a fantastic bartender. All of his wine and food choices were stellar! The small bite appetizer meatballs (which I would normally never order) were so good, I almost asked for a private moment.
The homemade pasta with pistachio pesto was a dream for my tastebuds! Truly amazing!
Ken was attentive, but not intrusive. Funny. Perfect night! : )","anita s.","Love their new dishes - Shrimp scampi with fried risotto. The shrimp were 3 tiger shrimp that cooked just right. The risotto was a bit heavy cuz it was fried with heavy cream. Still delicious!
I ordered the Mango cucumber mule was a bit sweet so I asked for extra ginger beer.
Panna cotta for dessert. A bit disappointed as I can tasted it was not made fresh at the daily basis. I ate half.
Service was great. My waitress came over a few times to check on me.
Note that they added 20% gratitude to the bill.","Megan R.","We stopped in here for a drink last weekend. It was in the morning so we were the only ones in the bar.
For one, the bar is super cute! I loved it right when I walked in.
Two, our bartender was AWESOME!! It was super slow and we were only getting a drink so he could've brushed us off but he was the total opposite!
So nice and friendly! Quick service and we just chatted about the city. It was such a great experience that we're going back for dinner soon.
His name is Alexander and he is great! Seriously, go see him! More industry people need to be like him! Nice, friendly and welcoming!","Vincent V.","How I wish to give Andare 5 stars because the staff consistently go out of their way to provide great service. I've visited several times for a quick dinner, bite to eat at the bar and for take out. The selection since the opening December '18 has remained the same and is limited albeit quite varied flavor wise - i.e., it doesn't appear they gave specials or a rotating menu. The food quality is very decent overall except for the pasta dishes where it appears that the management cuts corners with the ingredients.
Options cover a nice range from pizza to sandwiches. Taste tends towards spicy. The service in the main restaurant area is a bit different - place an order at the entrance through a tablet (someone is there to type it in for you), then wait for your food and drinks to arrive at a table of your choice. A 20% service charge is apparently no longer automatically included.
Noise level is average to loud depending on how many enthusiastic conference attendees are dining with you. Music tends to be 80s pop, not such a great choice for dining.","Tiffany Z.","I had the opportunity to attend a food tasting here and wow, I'm so glad I got to try more than I thought I would.
We started off with some cocktails. I forget the name (blood orange pellegrino?) but it was def strong considering we're here during lunch. It had a grapefruit or an orange which added a nice citrus taste. They serve with ice and a side of tonic water which when you add it to the drink, it turns the color to purple! It's original color is blue from butterfly pea.
For the appetizer, we started off with Caesar salad and their signature Andare salad. Both were light full of flavor! I especially love the lemon vinaigrette on the Andare salad! We also got to try the Andare signature meatballs and wowwww that was really good! The meatballs were so tender and the grilled pizza bread was so soft and chewy! Fantastic dish and a must try!
We then were served their signature cavatelli and fettuccine carbonara! Both were amazing and I loved the whip ricotta on top of the cavatelli! It added a nice creaminess to the overall taste! The carbonara was slightly too salty for me but man I couldn't stop myself from eating more of it! Love the addition of the egg yolk which added a velvety consistency to each bite!
Then moving onto more carbs-4 different types of Pizza!!! We tried their duck, prosciutto, mushroom, and margherita! All of them were fantastic but my fav was the prosciutto and mushroom! They were so full of flavor and the prosciutto pizza had a soft egg on it!! The duck was a close second while margherita is last just because I had it before! Their pizza is thin crust, making it easier to consume after all the carbs from the pasta lol
Lastly dessert! We tried their cannolis and gelatos. The cannolis has a strong cinnamon taste to; kind of reminds me of a Mexican chocolate cookie. The cherry jam added a nice sourness which helped with the sweetness!
We tried three diff flavors of gelato: pistachio, hazelnut, and berry. My personal fav was the hazelnut! It was so nutty and rich! The pistachio didn't have a strong enough pistachio flavor but it was still good! The berry was more like a sorbet kind of flavor but had a gelato creaminess consistency. It's served with fresh berries and a slice of lemon bar or some kind of bar.
Overall I had a fantastic experience here and I would really like to thank our host Tim who did an excellent job hosting and informing us about the restaurant and food!
Interesting fact: Andare means ""On the go"" in Italian! The restaurants concept is to be like a fast casual restaurant!","Huong L.","This place was an option for lunch on my lunch app so I decided to check it out and was pleasant surprise. This is located in the new Hyatt hotel and is consider more of a sit down fancy lunch rather than a quick to go lunch. However, this place exceeded my expectations for a quick lunch.
I ordered the chicken salad and when I arrived, it was ready in a nice paper bag. The lady saw me arrive and had it ready for me to grab. When I open the box, I was pleasantly surprise as well. The chicken was a generous portion and was juicy and tender. The salad was filled with artichoke, pistachio and cheese. All the ingredients was fresh and high quality. For the price, this is a really good deal.
Would definitely come back to try other things for lunch. This place is new so they are trying to promote their restaurant and they are doing a pretty good job at it. They also have happy hour as well.","Mandee O.","Finally got the chance to try Andare after a failed office lunch attempt where the building's fire alarms booted us. In natural fashion, we went back as an office for Happy Hour, because we were all still dying to try.
The ambiance is light, bright, open, chic and casual. The bar was full so we sat in the main dining area, where we were still able to order off of the Happy Hour Menu. Drinks for the table ordered: Manhattan, Aperol Spritz (only because NYT recently dissed them and we've never tried), Castleventrano Martini, and a great Red Wine pick from the bar manager. One of my coworkers knows what she wants in terms of taste of her wine, and they did a spot on job picking one out. All of the drinks were delicious and came out fast.
For food we ordered the Charcuterie Platter, Signature Meatballs & the Tuscan Bean and Kale Soup. Let me start with the Charcuterie platter, they say it is for 2, it's not, there were 4 of us and we barely finished it. It had a beautiful assortment of cheeses, meats, olives, veggies, etc. Everything was delicious. The meatballs (full order has 8 good sized balls), they were so flippin good. They do have a bit of spice to them, but I loved that part. Juicy, tender and an amazing sauce to dip the flatbread. The soup was delicious as well, jam packed with beans, kale and sausage goodness.
All in all, we all left satisfied. Service was amazing as was the rest. Will definitely be back to try some more dishes.","Amy E.","I was staying at the hotel, and decided I wanted some late night food to eat, so I came down to the bar area. The bar area has a limited menu, but I just wanted a pizza, so that was fine. The bartender was very friendly and nice. After waiting a long time there (35 minutes?), the bartender checks on the food, and they forgot to make it. The food then came out quickly. On the plus side, I got the food for free. However, it took a long time. It was a margherita pizza which was, meh. So overall, my experience was not great.","Terry C.","I live local but I was attending a convention over the weekend and stopped by the bar several times. Ken was terrific and super friendly, made some bomb drinks for us. The atmosphere was really nice, a lot of Christmas lights already in the hotel lobby. The mischievous meatballs were also really tasty!! Overall an incredible experience all weekend.","B G.","Here on a chilly evening and I couldn't have asked for a better comfort food meal. The carbonara and signature meatballs were delicious. The carbonara was creamy and sumptuous with crispy pancetta and the meatballs had just the right amount of spice to add balance.
Staff was attentive and friendly.","Ariana G.","Met a friend at Andare for lunch, and it did not disappoint! I had the carbonara which was phenomenal! My friend had the antipasto salad and meatballs on the side! She enjoyed both her dishes as well! Then for dessert we ordered the pistachio gelato and cannoli, both were great!
It's a beautifully designed restaurant inside of the Hyatt Regency. You order and pay before you sit down which makes it a great place to go for lunch if you work near by. The service was quick and good. We didn't get drinks this time, but it looked like they had a great bar and happy hour as well! Will definitely be coming back!","Heather F.","Tried to go here...closed except lobby and bar. My kids were with me, so we ended up going to the lobby. We were ignored, so we left.","Marina K.","Great place for HH! We came in on a wed at 4:30pm and needed to table for 8. Got in quickly and the waiter said they would split checks. (Big plus!) the happy Hour Menu has a good menu selection with $8 pretty big pizzas and $4 meatballs that came with some naan like bread- very good! Overall enjoyed this experience and will def be back for more HH dates and try dinner. A must try in the area. Great food and service! Bar area was pretty packed though, so def there early if you want to be in the bar area. HH is in bar area and front of restaurant.","Nelson L.","Ordered the Carne Pizza. Not bad, a little on the pricier side though. Restaurant itself is a solid, modern feel. Not sure if this happens to everyone, but I had to pay a 20% service charge.","Scott S.","I had high hope for this place and was in the mood for pasta carbonara. The service was not very welcoming at all. I stood there and waited for the person to look up and greet me before I could get a table. I was put off on the side. The waitress asked if I wanted anything other than water, but I wasn't given a drink menu. She seemed inconvenienced to go get one, but she did. I asked her if there was a smaller version of the salad to eat as a starter. She said I could get a side salad, so that's what I ordered. When it came to my table she stopped and ask if it was a good size in a patronizing fashion. The salad was served in too small of a bowl and difficult to eat. It didn't have much flavor and the lettuce was very watery. Before I got half way through the salad my pasta carbonara arrived. The person just laughed when she saw I still had half a salad and then walked away. The carbonara looked delicious but fell short on taste. It mainly tasted of garlic. It really needed some cheese which is important for a carbonara. I don't think I'll be coming back here.","Alina S.","Had an amazing lunch with coworkers and can't say enough good things about the service! Ken was attentive and extremely accommodating. Definitely went above and beyond!","John S.","Basic and Dependable Grab n Go Italian. The Andare Bar (AB) is a hilight. Excellent Service.
Fine but 22 bucks plus 20% or 28 bucks per drink is outrageous.","Carol C.","The bartender was great and accommodated my request to customize my drink as I was intrigued by an item on the menu, but am not a gin lover. 3 stars because none of the food items/drink items that were pictured (reasons why we came to this bar) were available or on the menu here. I was looking for the delicious carbonara and color changing drink, but was nowhere to be found! Color me disappointed, we only had one drink each and left quickly."
"Pizzuto’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzutos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Patty T.","I've been going here since I was a kid. The best pasta, pizza, Italian food you will try in Seattle. Seriously.
At such a reasonable price, this is why their lines are always out the doors and are sometimes an hour wait during their peak times. Just come prepared! :)
You truly can't make a mistake on their menu. I've tried a whole bunch of their pastas and have never been disappointed. Their pizzas, wow. The dough they make is just so perfect. That is why their bread that comes out with butter is phenomenal. All made in-house.
You walk in and it feels like a small little restaurant. Nothing fancy and that is the best part of it! You are truly here for the food.","Jessie B.","OH MY GOD.
YES.
Honestly go, it'll make you a better person.
Everything we've ordered has been amazing from the chicken parm to the life-changing carbonara. Staff is always delightful and they really know their stuff when it comes to wine-pairings and dish recommendations.
Couldn't recommend it enough.","Myranda M.","OMG!!!!!!!
Let's be honest. There are a number of Italian restaurants but it's hard to find a really good spot. Ladies and gentlemen this the spot. I can't believe this place has been under my nose and never visited. I love the neighborhood vibe as soon you walk through the door. It's not small but it's not super big.
I always like to give places the lasagna test because and as easy as it seems to make, I've encountered some horrible tasting lasagnas. This lasagna was hands down some of the best I've ever tasted. Everything about it was perfect. On top of everything the prices were very reasonable.
This place is definitely a gem and a must visit for authentic Italian.","Chris S.","The smell of garlic was in the air as we entered the large dining room and we were warmly greeted and quickly seated. The menu is extensive with several pizza options as well as several pasta, chicken, seafood and veal dishes.
Wine was very reasonably priced with glasses of house wine starting at just $5, a half liter for $12 and a liter for $20. I had a glass of their Sicilian Nero d'Avola ($6) which was dark, robust and filled to the brim ... HOOAH!
All meals come with soup or salad and fresh, warm, delicious bread and butter, ranging from $11 to $18.50. My wife had the Cheese Ravioli in Pesto Sauce ($12.50) and I the Veal Saltimbocca ($18.50). The salads were small, but fresh with lettuce, carrots, croutons and choice of dressing.
The ravioli was a bit of a disappointment with just ten on the plate, looking as if they were mass produced, not made in-house. The pesto sauce was pretty good, but my wife was still a bit hungry after finishing her small salad and ten medium size ravioli.
My veal was abundant and tasty, but not what I was expecting. Veal saltimbocca (alla Romana) normally comes with veal scallops topped with thin slices of prosciutto and topped with fresh mozzarella in a light sauce of butter, a little lemon and fresh sage, but this sauce was very spicy with a tomato base. It was good, but I was expecting something different. The spaghetti aglio e olio (garlic and olive oil) was also abundant and a good choice to accompany the saltimbocca.
My wife was born it Sicily and raised in Naples, Italy and I, beside being of Italian descent, lived in Italy for nearly three and a half years in addition to having traveled there extensively, so we have higher expectations than most when eating at Italian restaurants. Pizzuto's does a better job than many stateside Italian eateries and the prices are definitely affordable, but the food was not as authentic as it could have been. Had the salads been a little bigger, the ravioli more abundant, and the saltimbocca sauce more traditional, they would have definitely scored an extra bomb or two.
CombatCritic Gives Pizzuto's 6 Bombs Out Of 10 ... More Bombs Are Better!","Mo G.","Reminds me of home! Very homie experience and they served delicious bread with garlic spread!! The pasta dishes we ordered were just amazing!! Our waitress was funny, helpful and super sweet!!! Diggin' this place a lot and def will go back when k get a chance.","Wendy K.","My dad had been to Pizzuto's with friends and suggested coming here for dinner yesterday. I was a little worried cause I had to be home by 6:30 and we didn't get there till about 5:15 but everything went smoothly and I was hole in time.
They bring you a basket of hot scissor rolls I haven't had scissor rolls it was nice that the server said some were just out coming out of the oven and would be on there way. Entrees come with a small house salad don't see that often now days what a great touch. I grew up in Rainer Valley going to Vince's that's what Pizzuto's reminds me if a family owned restaurant great for family. It appeared
to be a neighborhood favorite. Wide variety of protein selections. Large portions and friendly service you'll definitely have leftovers. I had the shrimp scampi would probably go with a chicken dish next time flavor was good just expected the scampi to be a little bigger but wouldn't keep me from returning.","Scott W.","Horrible service. Sat there waiting for our order for over an hour, before we finally gave up and left. It was not even a complicated order, and there was only two of us.","Shawn H.","Pizzuto's WAS my absolutely favorite Italian spot in Seattle and we tried to go 2 or 3 times a month. However, ownership changed and although they were given all the original recipes, they have slowly been changing the recipes. The last two times I was there I was really disappointed. The ala amatraciana was on penne instead of spaghetti, the sauce was sweet instead of spicy, the sausages didn't have the same density or housemade taste they used to. I walked out thinking, I don't really have any need of coming back. My suggestion to the owners is don't mess with perfect recipes.","bobby b.","Fantastic staff ! Terrific warm bread ! The best meatball sandwich in the world . All the meals are outstanding ! And a wonderful dessert list !!! Bring the kids too .","Zelda H.","Horrible Italian food. Very mediocre Price is reasonable but I am not willing to pay for food that is not so good. Large portions over sauced. Pasta and meatballs not good. 1 star is too much.","Mike K.","Pizuttos is the perfect neighborhood Italian restaurant. I've been coming here nearly 20 years, since I moved to Seward Park.
Don't expect high end Italian, think red checked table cloths (though that just changed). Expect iceberg lettuce salad, minestrone, big portions, wonderful rolls and a great value in the 1/2 carafe wine.
We typically bring half our dinners home and we're not light eaters.
Always friendly staff and on a Friday night after a long week at work, Phone is a lovely way to unwind close to home and in the company of our neighborhood.
A gem and a blessing to have in this day of the next big thing dining in Seattle.","Gregg K.","My review is a generous four stars.
Pizzuto's is like every other neighborhood Italian-American restaurant that you can find all over the country. The menu is extensive, the prices are low, and the servings are very, very large.
The restaurant was filled to capacity by 7:30 p.m. on a Tuesday night, and it appeared there were a lot of locals by the greetings of the serving staff. Our server Rae was very nice, friendly, and took good care of us in the crowded setting.
One caveat is that like most Italian-American restaurants, canned olives are used on all the dishes such as the salads and pizzas.
We tasted three dishes, and they were all well-prepared and quite good.
If you're looking for authentic Italian, well, this may not be the place for you, but the food is good enough to make me want to return.","Linda E.","Excellent meal & atmosphere....had a party of 11 which they accommodated us well & waiter was personable. Have always had a delicious meal, last night Puttanesca!","Anonymous Z.","Nondescript place between a law firm and a coffee shop. Food is decent, except for the meatballs. They are too spicy, especially for a kids serving off spaghetti and meatball. They either need to alter their recipe or make separate meatballs for the kid's meals. Chicken/Veal Parm are great.
The carbonara is ok, but doesn't have peas!
Pizzas are great.","Phil R.","Great Italian food. Been here a couple times for family style dinners. Always a good spot for relaxed family dining. Tonight's service was very slow however. I hope this isn't the new trend in Seattle restaurants! I'll be back with fingers crossed for speedier service.","Kevin C.","This is exactly what you want from an Italian restaurant. Family-friendly service and delicious Italian food - with all of the classics. Our family ordered a custom pizza, carbonara, and a mixed Italian salad. Pasta tasted great with the Lucille IPA Excited to see this place continue to thrive.","itslikethisanna O.","Low key but delicious Italian restaurant. I've had a few of the pastas, gnocchi and carbonara being my favorites. Haven't tried the pizza yet, but will go for that next. Always take a tiramisu home for dessert. Prices are pretty good for Seattle. The quantity is large enough to either share or take home for another meal.","Diane B.","Great service and a forte sauce that has to be tasted to be believed - it is hot, spicy and DELICIOUS! The range of pastas are excellent. So, too, the Italian themed desserts. Save some space for the dessert.","Linda K.","Horrible Italian food. Not sure why people like this place. I live only 3 blocks away and have been here twice. First time I didn't like it. And a year later, I thought, I'll give it another try. I was wrong. It still is awful. I got a chicken dish with mushrooms and artichoke. It tasted entirely like alcohol, like they didn't cook the sauce off enough. My son got the mixed spaghetti and ravioli with meatball and sausage. Marinara is sour and sausage very dry. I cook better than this at home! The only thing going for this place is that it's a neighborhood place, portions are really large, and free soup or salad. Price is reasonable but I'd be willing to pay a little more for better tasting food. This has the same stars as La Medusa, a top Italian restaurant in seattle which is strange and why I rate this restaurant a 1 star.","BigCity G.","I know I am in the right place when I open the door and the welcoming aroma of roasted garlic wafts by. Food is very traditional/home-cooked comfort and the freshly baked bread is irresistible. Classics like veal parmigian with a side of bolognese spaghetti are delicious, and the heavier creamy pastas are perfect (especially if you're able to steal a few bites from your dining companion). MUST order the homemade caesar salad as your complimentary starter. The anchovies are mild and really add to the tasty, lighter dressing, but you can always request the salad with them. Service has always been warm and friendly. Friends recommend the pizza - I need to try it soon. I keep ordering an entree when I dine here. Highly recommended neighborhood gem!
To the owners: thank you for serving the community and warmest regards!"
"Sansonina Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sansonina-ristorante-italiano-renton?osq=Italian+Food","Julie Anne C.","Wow, wow, wow, what an amazing experience; the perfect place for the romantic, quiet birthday dinner I wanted!
The food was absolutely delicious, from bread to dessert. The restaurant is cute, well decorated, cozy and charming. Parking is easy and plentiful.
We were lucky enough to have Leo as our server; outstanding service, great sense of humor, and ultra attentive.
This place really cares about your comfort, happiness and overall experience. One of the owners, Fernando, checked on us several times, and was so genuine in his desire to make sure we were having an amazing experience - nice touch!
We can't wait to visit again!","Duncan B.","I wanted so badly for this place to be good. An upscale Italian restaurant would nicely flesh out the portfolio of Renton dining options. Unfortunately, despite a charming atmosphere, the food is just bad. Overpriced and bad.
My first visit I got the veal marsala and my companion got the chicken piccata. The veal was overly thick, unevenly cooked, and came in a watery, flavorless Marsala sauce. It tasted like cafeteria Salisbury steak. The chicken was somewhat better in so much as it tasted like chicken, but it was overcooked and tough. The Caesar salad was passable but certainly nothing to write home about.
I will give them credit for having a good tiramisu. Whatever bakery they partnered with is solid. Still, it was not enough to bring redemption to this establishment. Upon receiving the bill (over $100 for this debacle) I was filled with quiet rage.
Despite all of this, I foolishly returned to give them a second try. Nope. They sucked again.","Terri W.","We've been here twice now, and we like it.
Two dishes stand out for us: the Calamari Fritti, and the Tiramisu. My MIL got the Gamberoni Fiorentine which she really liked except that the spinach needed to be salted both times we were there. (They don't put salt on the table, so we had to ask for it to be brought, which is slightly embarrassing.) Hubs and I really love that fried calamari! We gobble it up like it's our last meal!
MIL also got the Chicken Picatta both times we were there, and she really loves it. Hubs did too. I got the Chicken Marsala on our first visit, and it was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. But in fairness to the restaurant, I need to explain. Many years ago, I tasted Chicken Marsala for the first time, and I fell in love with it. But I have never had one since then that tasted like that first one; nothing satisfies me. I'll optimistically order it on occasion, in the hope that I will love, it, but so far... no luck.
My recent main course was Alfredo with chicken. It was good, but the chicken pieces needed salt. The sauce didn't need salt, but the chicken did. (As I recall, the Marsala I ordered on my first visit also needed salt.) Hubby's recent main dish was Bolognese, which is often a favorite of his, but he said it was just okay.
On our first visit, we each got a dessert: the cannoli (no one really liked it very much), the raspberry-lemon tart (again, not that great), and the tiramisu (fantastic!). As far as we're concerned, the only dessert to get here is the excellent Tiramisu -- it's the best ever!
Both times we were there, we got seated at the same table, and had the same waiter. My MIL can be quite picky about her food preferences, and he was very accommodating. We appreciate that.","Ryan H.","This place was packed, we had a reservation and overheard walk in's talking with the host that there was a hour and a half wait. We had a small wait and then sat. We were offed bread with a pesto butter that my daughter was obsessed with. I ordered the tortellini con salmon and 2 glasses of the only moscato on the menu, the wine was very tasty thus why the second glass. The pasta was perfect although it was a hour before we got the food. I think the kitchen it a bit small for how many people were there. That is my only knock of the place. We never had a half filled water glass that is how attentive the wait staff was. Overall food was awesome and I would come back.","Smaly K.","It was time for a dinner date with my friend, and we usually need plenty of time to decide on where to eat. But this time, she already had this place in mind, having heard about how good this place was from her friend, so that definitely saved us the difficulty of choosing a restaurant.
She got here first and already started on the complimentary bread with the tasty flavored butter. We both started off with a glass of pinot grigio ($9 each) the Calamari Fritti ($16). The fries calamari was good with the cilantro aioli, but wasn't the greatest. My friend ordered the Linguine di Mare and I ordered the Penne con Pollo Diavola. I really enjoyed my pasta and the flavor of its garlic red pepper sauce. My friend seemed to enjoy her seafood pasta as well, since she finished it, and she doesn't finish all her food too often. We decided to take a look at the dessert menu, which the waiter then brought over a big platter displaying about eight different desserts. My friend and I decided on the Mixed Berry Torta, which was pretty good, not too heavy and not too sweet.
The service was excellent. All the staff members were very friendly, and they all made sure we were good.","Skeeter H.","This place has only been open for a handful of months but honestly some of the best Italian food we have ever had! The entrees came out fresh and pipping hot and the pasta was clearly home made. The sauce was vesty fresh and tasty and did not at all disappoint. Between my girl friend and I we both thoroughly enjoyed the ravioli and veal dishes and have decided we will add it into our regular rotation for treating us for a meal on the town. We also tried a cannoli and the tiramisu desserts and both are made at the restaurant and both were equally as good. Pricing for food was fair, the wait staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was nice!
Two thumbs us from us on this place!","Krista T.","WOW! A must try!
I decided to try Sansonina after several people on the I Love Renton! Facebook page recommended it. I placed a reservation on OpenTable and gave it a whirl.
The owners did a really great job of transforming this location (formerly Pizza Hut) into a very nice restaurant with plenty of space.
Okay, okay - let's get straight to the important stuff... THE FOOD.
APPETIZER & SALAD:
Gamberoni Fiorentini: 5 STARS. (Huge prawns, amazing flavor, must try if you love garlic. YUM)
Caesar Salad: 4 STARS (Not very big for $9, but the dressing is good.)
ENTREES
-Ravioli con Salsiccia
Sautéed bell peppers and red onions, spicy sausage, cilantro red sauce - 5 STARS
-Seafood Cioppino - 5 STARS (LOADED with seafood and had a nice spice to it. He loved it.)
-Ravioli con Salsiccia - 5 STARS (HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
A large portion, the cilantro red sauce was very unique and delicious,
the sausage was top-notch...oh and the ravioli! So good.)
DESSERT:
- Key Lime Pie: 4 STARS. Enough to be split between 3 people.
Overall: Sansonina blew me away. Quality, flavorful food within a nice atmosphere and very attentive service. I will be back again!","Ra W.","This places vibe is amazing, rite in the middle of the hood! But this that bring bae and eat good OKK - the chefs beenn cooking for 20 years, hosts where host was SOOOO NICE and the food came out in less than 30 minutes here's the pictures","Thao N.","Been wanting to try this place out as it was recommended to me by somebody in the food community, but it's closed on my one day off so super excited to have made the time to finally come here! My friend treated me to this restaurant for my birthday & I had a great time catching up while enjoying beautifully presented food in a nice atmosphere. To my surprise, Sansaonina took over the old Pizza Hut & converted it to this new restaurant. I grew up around this area & just thought it was cool when my gps took me here because it's now probably one of the nicest restaurant located in this neighborhood besides Melrose Grill.
This is one of those places that you come for a special celebration/occasion because they have an extensive wine list, but this is good if you're simply just craving Italian food on a random Tuesday evening also. The space is small & intimate, easy to get your server's attention. My rule of thumb is just if I can't make out easily what the menu is saying with the fancy language, it's probably legit Italian food. Parking is really easy, plenty of space in the back if the front gets full.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)","Michael L.","Came back to Sansonia for the great food and service. Our host and manager was very attentive to our every need. Hands down one of the best Italian restaurants around the south end of the Seattle City limits. They sat us at the ""special"" table near the front of the restaurant that you need to reserve ahead of time..we felt like royalty lol! Again the food and desserts we selected did not disappoint. Such an amazing dinner with amazing family and of course amazing service. Go here once and you'll feel like home...an Italian home!","Jill B.","I sort of don't want to review this place to keep it a Renton secret. This is literally the best Italian restaurant I've ever been to. The ambiance is romantic and cozy, the wait staff is friendly and attentive, and the food is amazing. I got the pasta carbonara this time and my husband got one of the chef's specials we enjoyed the calamari and a key lime pie with raspberry sauce as well. It is not cheap ($20-$30 entrees) but the ingredients are fresh and the meals are divine. We'll be back for special occasions and will spread the word about how great this restaurant is!","Paulina W.","So I hAve to saY this place is amazing!!! The food was unbelievable and the dessert.... yummmm! It's a tiny little place and loud but so worth it! You must try tHis place out!","Karen B.","In a word, it was lovely. The food, the wine, the service... All top notch. I'm so glad Renton has another fine restaurant to choose from. I hope they do well because I plan on going back soon. I had the Tortellini Gorgonzola con Salmon and it was delicious. My mom had the Seafood Cioppino and she loved it. Full of calamari, mussels, shrimp and fish. Our server was pleasant and well versed on the food and wine menus. The runners never let a glass of water get less than full. Il pasto era delizioso!","Sonca E.","Great service... food was amazing. I love this place. Will definitely be back like
A hundred more times ! One of the best meals I've ever had. My cousin and I pretty much licked the plates clean, the food was that amazing!!! This is a must eat place if you're in Renton ! Just wow !!!!","Jonathan D.","This is a new Italian restaurant in Renton! You must try it! I've already been twice in a week! The food is absolutely amazing it left me wanting more! I had the chicken Piccata and by far the best I've had in the Seattle area!
The service was awesome they were very attentive and fun! The General Manager was also very involved in his customers making sure everyone was having a great experience and everything was perfect.
I'm very excited to have a new great Italian restaurant in the area!","Nancy W.","Have been here a number of times since they opened, the first being for my birthday back in April. The owner/manager is from Spain and is not only gracious and friendly, but his attention to detail is impeccable! I ate here just the other night with a group of six ladies and he was kind enough to seat us in the private booth, which is usually reserved for special occasions All six of us got different items from fresh sauteed halibut to chicken cacciatore to spaghetti bolognese. Presentation is beyond lovely, fresh toasted bread with garlic butter is addictive and atmosphere is warm and cozy. The only downside is that they're still waiting for their liquor license which hopefully will be coming very soon.","Achita S.","Decent Italian food with super friendly service. The prices are affordable ( you get what you pay for) the portions are pretty big.
I'd definitely be back if I'm visiting WA again .","Jo-Nathan T.","Cozy atmosphere, great servers and really tasty food! You can't go wrong with this place!","June C.","Ok, great new family owned restaurant in Renton. They make all the pasta in-house. Great service and very attentive staff. We started with salads. I had the Cesar which was good. My husband ordered the Greek salad which he said was outstanding with the dressing perfect. For the main course, I had the carbonara which the Waite staff said was grandmas recipe. Very rich and yummy! Husband ordered the ravioli which he says was also exceptional. The desert tray looked amazing but way too full for that. Next time I will remember to save room!","Francesco L.","The inside is very elegant and the owner is super nice. The food came out in great time and it was delicious! Would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting great Italian Food"
"Pizza and Pasta Bar","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizza-and-pasta-bar-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Aimee B.","My coworkers got some chowder next door and we decided to come here for some beer. They have draft Stove Brewing. They actually brew next door to the restaurant as well. The staff is so kind. It was fun to talk to Bruno the owner. And his apprentice Marcus was awesome! Bruno gave me a pistachio macaroon with my beer! It was so freaking delicious. There was still a little sweetness but nice and light.
I didn't get any food because had just eaten. But the beer and macaroon was yum! I really love their remodel as well. It puts the whole place together. Also they have a new state of the art pizza oven. It can cook pizza in like 12 seconds. Something crazy like that. Of course I'm exaggerating. Definitely go try out it!","Christina C.","Really interesting concept of Pizza and Pasta bar where you can get quick cooked meal for price of the restaurant food. We payed $45 for lunch meal (ouchhhh) My husband took chicken pesto penne pasta and I took lobster ravioli. His pasta was OK but chicken was extra $3 and it tasted like warmed leftover chicken.I didn't had high expectations for lobster ravioli at this place but since its my fav dish I decided to try. Pasta dough was horrible, it was undercooked and lobster meat inside tasted like this pasta that you buy at the supermarket. I am big fan of Italian food and I traveled a lot across the Italy and I am sorry I cant call it Pasta. For a counter service restaurant, I think the prices are way too high. Parmesan cheese containers in every table, and they were all empty (PS its not a real parmesan cheese). This counter service restaurant its overpriced.
Dear Owner,
Thank you for your advice but I don't need to be pointed out where I may or may not eat. I am free to eat anywhere I want or say HOW I felt about my experience. My review was honest and many people wrote the same thing- its overpriced, empty cheese containers, bad service, tasteless pasta. I didn't said anything about bad service but after your response I don't think you can take honest critics to improve your business. Seems I am not only one who got a rude response from the owner (you tell people they are welcome not to come back/eat somewhere else). Many people who were honest that they didn't like something got an unpleasant message from You. My 3 stars were not a bad review but room to improve because my husbands pasta tasted OK but mine was completely undercooked. I don't want to talk about heritage and compare who knows the best. My point was that I (personally) can't call it pasta and it's my opinion. Unfortunately some people can't take the constructive criticism.","Emily Z.","Bad service and overpriced pizza that made my friend and I feel unwell.
Service: The man at the counter kept on messing up our order even though we only ordered 4 slices. First he claimed that my friend only ordered one and wanted to charge her again for a second slice even though she clearly already paid over $14 for two slices. Then he kept on forgetting who ordered what even though half their pizza options were unavailable and we simply ordered 2 cheese slices and 2 meat lover slices. Though we clarified with him 3 times, he STILL tried to give me a cheese slice though I ordered meat lovers.
Price: $6 for cheese, $7 for anything else, +$0.50 for using card if your order is under $10 -- with tax my single slice was over $8, which is enough to get an entire pizza at MOD!
Food: Taste was mediocre at best and now my friend and I feel very unwell. I feel very queasy and dizzy. I will never come here again -- definitely do NOT recommend!","Rachael H.","Spent time here while walking around Pike Place. The owners were very sweet and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great experience. We ordered the lasagna with meat sauce and garlic bread. Highly recommend!","John F.","7/5/19
Sparkling water is something this place has. They even had blue power aide too. The pizza choices were pretty simple. This is the good news.
This place did not customize orders and the woman/cashier was not the friendliest of people I met. She greeted us, but could not seem to keep her attention on her guest who were ordering food.
The pizza was decent, but not the best pizza I have tasted. I did not see any plastic utensils and trying to get the woman's attention again to ask did not seem appealing. The Male manager pretty much had the same attitude as the woman.
Don't see us going back to this mom and pop store anytime soon.","Jason N.","After trying the pasta and enjoying it, we decided to get a few slices of pizza to try and take home. We tried the pizza fresh out of the over, and it was delicious. The next day, we warmed up the remaining slices and they were still pretty good.
I'd recommend getting a whole pizza and eating it when it's fresh out of the oven. You can't beat it!","Kunous K.","The pasta is good, everything cook to perfect, just a bit slow... And they forget my garlic bread...
The weird thing was when I ""check-in"" and there's a coupon pop-up ""spend $40 get a free pasta"", showed to the cashier, she called the boss, nobody know anything about it!!! He gave me a free pasta anyway...","DJ D.","I would say that this is a tourist trap because they have nice design, excellent location within pike place, but mediocre food at a high price (does that meet tourist trap criteria)? My slice of pepperoni pizza took about 15 minutes to come out on a Saturday afternoon, and when it arrived I was shocked at how small and meager it appeared (good size for a my five-year-old god son). The flavor was decent but overall nothing special. They also charge 50 cents for purchases under $10 so this child-sized slice of mediocre pizza came out to just over $7. I would not return. There are many better places a stone's throw from here.","Sheila G.","Delicious pasta and salads - almost everything is made in house!
The interior is really cute, the service is really great. All around the experience was great. I recommend this place for anyone looking for some great pasta at a great price!!","Juan B.","Very overpriced.
I had their pasta cacio e pepe, and my husband had the butternut squash ravioli with pesto. For a counter service restaurant, I think the prices are way too high. The cashier was not very friendly at all, either. The food was just okay. You have to pay extra for things like $3 for pesto with your ravioli... that's a bit much. They also had Parmesan cheese containers in every table, and they were all empty. When we asked the lady in the counter if they had more, she just said to look for another one in the restaurant... not great considering that they were all literally empty.","Andrea M.","The pizza and pasta is so good! The place itself is smaller with not much seating, but I feel like that makes it better. The service here is amazing! They were very sweet and friendly. We had a large group and some of us had soup from the place next door, but they did not mind that we brought our soup to sit with the rest of our group. Highly recommend.","Maya D.","Great place to grab a hot slice for lunch. The sauce is tasty, accented by fresh herbs and toppings. The staff is friendly.
I was searching for a nice slice of pepperoni and found it. The crust is not the chewy NY crust I had hoped for but it is flaky and delicious.","Laura P.","If you want to find the diamond in the rough..this place takes it to a whole new level of delicious.","Nathan W.","I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo with Sausage ($20) and it was AMAZING. It was a little pricey but I believe it's worth the price for something at Pike Place Market. They cooked the food quickly too. The sauce wasn't too thick or overwhelming. It was rich, yet easy to eat. Usually if the sauce is too strong, people get sick of it. But their sauce was delicious and I had no problem finishing the whole plate of pasta. They also sprinkle parmesan cheese on top which adds a nice finish to the pasta. The sausage was pretty standard, nothing special but nothing bad either. I would totally recommend trying this spot out if you want to avoid the crowds at Pike Place. The owner/workers are really friendly too!","Matt S.","Ordered through Grubhub. Was excited to try ""the best meatball sandwich in Seattle."" When it showed up it looked really good. I took a few bites, and it tasted as good as it looked. Unfortunately, when I set the sandwich down, I noticed multiple hairs in the food. I pulled them out of the sauce. When I contacted the restaurant, the manager or owner basically said it wasn't his fault and insinuated that he didn't believe me. He did offer to replace the item and add a complimentary dessert, but wouldn't accept responsibility for the mistake, and continued to insinuate that I was lying. I turned down the replacement and was refunded by Grubhub. Their customer service and being called a liar is enough to keep me from ever returning.","Corinna M.","My family has to give a huge THANK YOU to this establishment for wonderful service! We were walking around the marketplace for our first time after traveling all day. Little did we know that the stores start closing shop so early. We walked in 5 minutes before closing and placed an order for 4 people. The gentleman at the counter was so friendly even at the end of his day. He offered my children some macaroons to taste. He was just so helpful to these weary tourists with hangry kids.
We took our food to the hotel. Everything was delicious but I especially loved the butternut squash ravioli. Pasta was fresh and sauces were outstanding.
This shop is tucked inside the building behind the chowder place. I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for tasty pasta Support a wonderful business who knows the true meaning of customer service","Ciara U.","Came here since the entire time I was in Seattle, I was craving Spaghetti. First thing I noticed was this place was empty. There was a woman, man and young man working. Next thing I noticed was their prices.... $18 for spaghetti at a hole in the wall. WTH?!?! But I really wanted it so I ordered it. They had a special that day and it was $15 for it so I saved $3 bucks. My mom was with me but wasn't planning on ordering since we all were getting different places she wanted to nibble on everything. The lady (who I believe was also an owner) charged me a $3 split fee?!?! WTH. I wasn't splitting it and I wasn't eating in either. My mom kinda handled that situation and the lady took off the $3 but was very rude and not personable at all. After my spaghetti and 2 drinks it came out to damn near $30. $8 for two 16oz soda? Geez. While the young man was cooking my food I asked for it to go Incase they didn't realize. But I noticed on the menu that they charge you for boxes! What in the world. Never have I ever been to a restaurant or take out place where you get charged for a box. That's just greedy and unnecessary. The young man was very nice and so was the man who I believe is also an owner. But that lady needs to be thrown in the back where no one can talk to her until she learns how to be polite. The spaghetti however was very delicious and it's probably the only reason for the star. Despite the tiny portion for the price, It had great flavor & tasted authentic. The salad was gross and the garlic bread was decent. Definitely not worth $18.
Trust me... don't do it!","Gloria S.","Came to Seattle for the weekend and wanted pizza. No other place i would've wanted to eat a pie at ! The owner and employees were all great. Cheers from sunny California","Vanessa L.","We didn't know what to eat and stumbled across this pasta bar and decided to try it. This place was ok to me. Average pasta, nothing too spectacular. I didn't think it had much flavor and I remember it being quite expensive. Definitely had better pasta!","Ava K.","Every eatery in the area seemed slammed around lunchtime, but this place is a little hidden so it only had a few customers. Got a meatball sub, which was delicious. It's big enough to share. The employees were nice. Place is small with limited seating. Luckily we were able to get seats."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-7?osq=Italian+Food","Drew T.","I love this place I used to live next to the one in West Seattle. And have visited the Mount Baker location a few times. This week my girl friend and I visited for a much needed drink after work. They have an awesome Happy Hour menu from 4-6 (not all pizzas and apps are on it but the dishes hit the spot.) We had four dishes: two pizzas, antipasti, and a salad plus two drinks and it came to a total of $50. Now that's a deal! I can't wait to come back in the spring/summer when the windows are open.
Props to Thomas who was an awesome server when though the restaurant was packed.","Wendy K.","1/1/20
Dad and I were looking for some place open on new year's day for lunch and we found Mioposto open. Being a holiday and probably one of the few places open they were swamped. But their crew remained professional, friendly and with a smile through it all. Ee could tell the kitchen was a little backed up but they were working their as hard as they could, non stop cranking quality food out. Great customer service and the egg in my shakshuka was cooked perfectly I've been other places that over cooked it so much it was hard boiled. Thanks for starting our year off perfectly!
11/23/18 Came her post holiday half off sock shopping with my dad and sister. Was about 10:30 found parking right across the street. Placed our order at the counter and our food and coffee were delivered. Been a few times since my first review. Tried something new. My sis had the PANENATA
Mio Baked Bread soaked in egg custard oven roasted in a skillet with apples & pancetta, finished with cinnamon and powdered sugar. Served with organic maple syrup. A great salty sweet combo. Dad and I had the hash I love that it cones with arugula adds nice freshness to the hash. Service is always friendly great neighborhood go to","Danielle D.","This place is always delicious! I love coming in for brunch. The chai is fantastic and the breakfast pizza is just the perfect amount of spicy!
I wasn't a fan of the potato and truffle oil pizza when I came here for dinner but everything else I've ever had here has been superb! The ambiance is super quaint and charming, the entire staff is super nice and attentive. A really cute date spot and also great for a big group of friends!","Seth O.","Been here a few times but really love their happy hour. Their pies are the perfect snack size and haven't plenty of other options to get your fill. Great place to catch up or quick stop. Whatever you're looking for this checks the box","Victoria V.","This place has a great happy hour! I stop in here every once in a while with coworkers and it does not disappoint! You can order a selection of personal pizzas, salads, drinks, and appetizers for under $10 each. The regular prices aren't terrible either, but if your curious, I'd opt for the happy hour just to try it out first. I usually order the antipasti because of the large portions and delicious taste. I'm not much of a pizza person, but I will say that their crust is amazing! Everything is stone fired so it has a wonderful texture with just a hint of smokey-ness. Yum! One thing to note though is that this place is no secret. It's loved by many so if you don't go early, or make a reservation, you will be waiting. Enjoy!","Caroline T.","I'm trying to find a go to pizza place, but sadly I still haven't found it.
Mioposto is one of the better reviewed pizza offerings through Caviar, and I'm always game for a Margherita pizza. The pizza that I received was just okay, but didn't make me feel the $14.95 price matched the quality or the size.
The pizza was more dough than pizza (even distribution of sauce, cheese, and dough). For being wood fired, the pizza felt pretty soggy (I put it in the oven for a 2nd cooking just in case, after trying one slice).
If I give Mioposto another go, whether via delivery or in person, I'll update the review but for now shelling out almost $15 for a trial run doesn't seem worth the hassle.","Katy P.","Amazing food and great atmosphere!
This pizza shop was a great place for me to meet a friend. I ordered their lunch special: a Prosciutto e Arugula personal pizza and a side Cesar salad. The pizza was some of the best I had - crispy, Italian style with obviously fresh ingredients. Their Cesar salad was nicely balanced and a great complement. The number one thing I loved was the service. Our waitress was extremely attentive but gave my friend and I enough space to chat. We must've talked at our table for a couple of hours but our waitress was immediate on getting our checks and not bothersome when we delved into our conversation. I would definitely come back for their food and definitely recommend this as a good meeting spot!","Jasmine S.","At first I wasn't impressed by their menu because the pasta options seemed pretty limited. I'm so glad I still went!! My sister opened their entrance door and we were instantly welcomed by the fresh aroma of basil and fresh tomatoes. We tried ""La Bianca"" and ""Zucca Balsamica"", both great and flavorful pizzas! I would also highly recommend ""Ceci"" and and the ""Garnet"" salad! Amazing flavors and very well presented.","Jaime C.","Wow. Amazing pizza. Period!
This was my second visit and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed.
I had their Margarita pizza - it was the best Margarita I've ever had. My sister and so ordered the Zucca Balsamica. It was hard to decide which was my favorite. The crust was delicious. The toppings on the Zucca was a perfect mix of flavors.
It was also fun to watch the pizza chef cook them in the wood fireplace.","Christina H.","LOVED this cozy neighborhood, wood-fired pizza spot!
First of all, the location is very cute. It's in a pretty neighborhood with a park across the street. Nice outdoor and indoor seating (some of the seats indoor have open windows with a pretty view of the neighborhood).
We went on the weekend (late Saturday afternoon) and opted for their small salad and pizza combo (note: it's only available until 3pm), which was a steal (I believe it was $14/person, but I could be a few dollars off). I got the beet salad and margarita pizza (extra crispy) and my husband got the caesar salad and pepperoni pizza with prosciutto on the side. We both LOVED everything! The beet salad was perfectly tossed in dressing and I loved the crumbled almonds. The pizzas were a smaller size on the combo special, so that made us feel a little healthier :) They were perfectly crispy with a perfect balance of flavors.
We also tried a few Washington wines. My husband got their cab and I got the red blend. Both of us were impressed! The red blend was very full-bodied and so smooth.
The service was great as well! Everythign was timed well with apps coming out and then the pizzas shortly afterwards.
If you are looking for a great go-to pizza spot, I highly recommend giving this spot a try!","Stefanie A.","Went here for lunch with my boyfriend on our last day in the area, and everything was amazing! Service was so warm and welcoming, drinks were delightful and the pizza! It was delicious even for one of the more safe/basic options they had. Would love to come back here, it's right across the street from a park too so we had a nice view for lunch.","Tom E.","Delicious, interesting unusual flavors like lamb pizza and clam-proscuttio. Fresh handmade dough, nicely toasted crust, and some of the delicate ingredients added late in the cooking process so they weren't overcooked. Really friendly knowledgeable and warm service, and a beautiful summery setting next to a park.","Tami G.","I am housesitting down the street and my roomate and I popped in for breakfast this morning. I ordered the breakfast hash, and he the Shakshouka (spelling?) with a side of hashbrowns. Food was decent. The location and atmosphere and service were great, food was just ok. I would be curious how the pizza tastes, and would be willing to try that but with a gluten allergy, italian places dont usually cater well to me. I was impressed that they brought hot sauce with breakfast, and no ketchup in sight, in fact, they dont even have it! Cute spot though. Glad we stopped by. Ill update if I ever get to try that pizza, but if you have a gluten allergy they do list the allergens on the menu which is nice.","Paige W.","Great service. Lovely food. Cozy and charming ambiance. Happy hour selection is quite amazing, as well.","Abby K.","This is a great spot in Mt. Baker. We ordered the lamb sausage pizza, clams with bread and a glass of Chardonnay and a local cider. Everything was phenomenal and the service was lovely too. Unfortunately we were too full to try dessert but they had options that sounded delicious like a rum-spiked tiramisu and amaretto hazelnut ice cream. Next time! We also weathered a major thunderstorm and briefly lost power during dinner. No interruptions in service.","Rachel P.","No trip to Seattle is complete without my Mioposto! I usually stay nearby the Mt. Baker joint, or within commuting distance. My first time here, I dined in because it was summer, and I was staying nearby in an Airbnb - they recommended this place!
I don't eat meat, but that doesn't matter. You need to try the Quattro Formaggi pizza! The lemon zest makes it!!!
In fact, I have recommended this pizza by word of mouth than any other restaurant I've ever been to!!!
Last trip I ordered via a delivery service as it was further away, raining, cold, and I had had a cocktail or two! I am happy to know I can get my order in! I ordered 2 pizzas: my usual & the crowd favourite Con le Petate.
My take on the Patate: wayyyy too much oil. Like the pizza crust was soaked in oil and the box even was leaking oil all over. I think the chef used the whole bottle of truffle oil on it. It was 15,000 calories a slice after that. The taste was good, but you just can't get the oils off of your hands or palate for hours. Worst of all: I made a huge mess at my host's place by placing the box on the counter while I ate (yes, I cleaned it up but took ages). Would I order it again? Absolutely no!!!
Stick with the Quattro Formaggi...sincerely the best pizza I have ever had!","Candace H.","Mioposto is located on the corner of a cute neighborhood in south seattle. We came here on a Sunday around 11:45a as a party of 2 and did not have to wait for seating. The restaurant was about 1/2 full when we got there.
They have tables throughout their restaurant but also 4 spots of high top window seating at the front. We got seated by the windows which was perfect on a spring seattle morning! You get to people watch as you eat too because there's a cute park right across the street.
They have a brunch menu available so of course we went for those options. The waiter was really kind to walk us through the menu and I thought it was cool that everything was cooked in their fire oven. We ended up getting...
-THE BAKER - kind of reminded me of a shakshuka and i'm not entirely sure why it wasn't called a shakshuka because it tasted like and texturally was so similar to one! This dish was delicious and it comes with their house made bread. Their eggs were perfectly poached and the yolks were runny.
-MORNING HASH - what is brunch without hash browns? Their hashbrowns are cooked in a skillet in their fire oven to get that extra crispyness. You can get the eggs how you want, we chose sunny side up, one of the eggs was sunny and runny but the other was kind of cooked which was a little disappointing. Pancetta was crispy and flavorful and the arugula pairs well with the dish for a refreshing little kick of flavor and texture.
Our waiter also served our food and came with mini bottles of cholula and tapatio hot sauce; this i really appreciated and im sure all condiments/cholula/tapatio-on-brekkie-food friends can relate ;)
Overall a great experience and they actually do bottomless mimosas for brunch (i noticed this a little too late!) which I have to come back for next time! Their breakfast stramboli (like a breakfast calzone) sounded and looked awesome (yes i also spy on what my neighboring strangers order...) and I would love to try that next time.","June C.","Ok, great spot for a family dinner or date! Super loved the small space and intimate atmosphere. We arrived 5 pm on a Sunday and full but still places to sit. Never a wait for a table the whole time we were here. Started with happy hr specials that go to 6 pm every day. Great salads and drinks and small plates and pizza. We shared a delicious beet salad and wonderful zucca balsamic pizza! So yummy! Very great wait staff and especially Christie! She was fantastic!!! We will come again many times.","Stacy S.","I am giving 4 stars due to the service. My friends took me here for my 18th birthday and when we arrived, we were told it was a 25 minute wait, but we waited almost an hour. We wouldn't have minded an hour wait, but the upsetting part is being told a false wait time. It also seemed like staff was taking their time.
The actual server we had was really nice even though she had lost her voice. I liked her service a lot, she wished me a happy birthday like 3 times, made me feel kinda special.
Now for the food.
We got the potato pizza and the classic pizza (forgot the names). The pizza with the thinly sliced potatoes was amazing! I have never had a pizza with potatoes on it, it was so unique and delicious. The other pizza was just a cheese pizza, but not much cheese. It was still yummy though.
To top off the night, we had ordered their chocolate mousse cake and it was fucking bomb as hell. I was going to eat the whole thing by myself, but I had to let my friends try a little bit to experience the taste (plus they brought 3 forks LOL). I loved the cake and I'll probably come back just for the cake alone.
I believe this place doesn't take reservations unless it's a large group, so just be prepared for some waiting. There's really nowhere to wait except in the crowded entry way. For the business, I would recommend setting up a text messaging system to alert people when their table is going to be ready.","Mike S.","I have driven by this corner for 20+ years and never stopped in until yesterday. I went to Mioposto not knowing what they served for food or anything at all just based on the location and the look from outside. The restaurant has a new and warm/inviting feel to it. It just seemed like a good place to be. They have very large open windows for air to flow through on the hot summer nights. People were sitting inside and outside the restaurant.
We just walked in at 8pm with 4 people,no wait. The server was very friendly and fast, our drinks came in a couple minutes.
The prices were reasonable for Seattle. I ordered a meatball sandwich, others had a pizza, lasagna, and a beat salad with chicken.
We were all happy with the experience and I would recommend to anyone to check the place out."
"Bar Taglio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-taglio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Robert V.","I just had the best experience at Bar Taglio. Nice people (thank you Lindsey and Veronica) and delicious food and drink. I was in a rush to make a ferry, so had one cocktail and a piece of pizza. The vesper was perfect and the pizza - Roman style with Bainbridge Island made guanciale - carbonara was incredible. I can't wait to spend a little more time there.
---------
So another trip to Bar Taglio, where once again I'm amazed by the service, food and drink. What a a awesome spot. Thing is I know how hArd it is to a achieve consistency, but each time I drop in the only sad part is leaving.","Erica W.","I discovered this place after visiting a Skin care clinic next door. Located in the exchange building, this cute little bar is a perfect spot for a little post work happy hour!
They have a full bar, if that's what you're into. They have a small but decent tap list; all of which were all local, and no crap on tap. There's also wine options, but isn't that a given?
Let me get to this pizza. I haven't stopped talking about it since I visited.
My friend and I each got a few different slices.
I got the Potate (potato) pizza. The rosemary and potato were the perfect combo!
My second piece was a prosciutto pizza. It was pretty good, but the potato pizza was the clear winner in the head to head!
My friend had gotten a few options (fungi & squash) which was more adventurous than this picky eater was willing to try. She spoke highly about them, but I can't personally vouch.
This place is great, although a little expensive for a HH. My bill was close to $50. Kind of a bougie HH if you ask me. However, the service was great, and the pizza was delicious - so I didn't mind spending a little more.
Definitely will be back for more of that BOMB Potate pizza!","Cara L.","This review is for cocktails only.
I stopped in the other day for a meeting and had a great bar experience. I opted for the logatto and it was so delicious. The bartender described it as a salty dog, but with tequila. And it was similar, but way better. I think it was the truffle salt that put it over the edge.
The service was super friendly, but not too clingy. And the food I saw come out of the kitchen looked really tasty.
I can't wait to come back!","Jason P.","I always have preferred the square style pizza over other slices weather it is a grandma's style or the Roman style pie so when Bar Taglio opened couple of blocks from my work place I had to try it out.
Right next to cafe hitchcock in the exchange building on first avenue, it's pretty easy to get to though parking may be a little hard around this area.
The restaurant is really nice, the standard mix of comfy bar and industrial feel of Seattle. There is a long bar with some more high table bar seating, normal tables and booths.
The service was good and fairly attentive though the pizza came out a little slow even though I came at around one and there was a few other customers.
Order two different slices, a margarita and a bologna. Both were very good though I prefer a more doughy crust. The crust was more crispy and air but that just my personal preference. Will definitely be back to try there other pizza options and the other things on the menu.","L L.","So glad I found this spot. It's a relatively new restaurant in Seattle the food is spot on","Ron G.","We have been watching this place around the corner and finally got a moment to give a go. Wow! Amazing food, great wine list including many wonderful selections from Italy, France and beyond.
Alex was very helpful on picking out something we all enjoyed. Thank you! Can't wait to go back!","Angelo R.","Delicious pizza, impeccable service, and amazing drinks and beer. Classy atmosphere, and still very comfortable. Friendly service, warm and cozy environment, and was perfect for our late lunch. Highly recommend.","Terrence M.","'Taglio' means cut, clip, slice, etc.
Truly and humbly, I will not say this lightly. You could have fooled me that this is a restaurant that has only been open for one week.
There are many well established restaurants doing great food and good deeds in sometimes unusual and sometimes predictable ways. Taglio doesn't care. Bar Taglio doesn't seem to care that it lacks the generic lingo and speak of PNW restaurants. No hipster stares, weird mustaches, ""farm to table"" or ""bottles and cans"" corny and canned, copycat menu references here. Taglio doesn't seem to think it's service be new or novice or a work in progress. This is a baby who never crawled! The service I have received on two visits, on back-to-back days has rivaled and already surpassed 90 percent of all restaurants in Seattle.
It's not trying to be perfect but it is certainly trying not to be lazy! Not a lazy bone! Shot out to members Jack, Shiori, and Alex for outstanding low-key and fierce attention to detail. These guys are a testament to the ownership, Chef and management. Did I mention they have only been open for one week? Paper menus are clean and clipped, waiters are polishing everything always, constantly polishing utensils in the open for all to see. Clean plates always, constant table attention but not in an eagerly pretentious way or for show. Go with it, encourage it.
Everything you eat with is just as clean and meticulous as what you actually eat. Roman slices of beautiful lobster mushrooms and taleggio. Crispy textures, glossy fishes, transparent sun dried raisins, fermented tart and sweet local plums, strikingly fresh parsley, radicchio and chicory leaves stacked curling upward toward heaven. First press expensive Italian olive oils generously hug and high five Italian salt.
The front and back of house duet, not duel. I love, absolutely love when chefs help expedite their food to the tables!! Here and there, chefs randomly exit double doors ferrying your selections and briefly describe them to you. They are humble in personality, wearing clean and pristine stately pinstriped aprons atop chef coats and caps. These chefs are comfortable, easy to talk to, clean, not full of tattoos and piercings, so well kept, and they know their table numbers. Such a nice and smart touch having them come out to tables and it is obvious they like it. Stunning!!
Value is keen to turn your head. For example, only $9.00 for a solid square of perfect fungi pizza with glorious chanterelle and lobster mushrooms, warm and thick taleggio, oil and herbs. An average piece of so-so pizza in Seattle is $6.00, here you get 3X the taste, quality and experience. Ambiance is simple, clean, non-distracting to your conversation and cohesive with the food's own ambiance. Perfect for an informal date, business get together and ideal for tourists who cant get a table in Seattle's most popular areas and markets. Tourists, I would convince you to see that this chef uses many of the same sources as many of the best restaurants in town but does an equal and surpassing job in using them to your delight! Come here, avoid the traffic, the wait, the clutter, you will likely have a better meal. Relax in comfortable chairs, bar stools, sofas, and enjoy your own company or come with others and talk. The music isn't too loud or offensive. The kitchen isn't open and the energy is relaxed elegance.
Stunningly simple and in their own world! I've never done this, screw it...
SIX STARS******!!!","Alexa P.","Delicious apps, salads, and pizza. I highly recommend Nahum's Fresh Cheese, the zucchini salad, and the salame pizza!! Service is really friendly and the food is top notch.","Travis J.","I've been in twice now and am a fan. First time to grab a quick drink, the bitter kiss was very tasty. Stopped by for dinner on Sat on the way to the symphony. Started with the roasted cauliflower which was very tasty and some warm olives w/ herbs. We split 3 slices of pizza, all were very good and was a good amount of food for 2. Finished with a espresso martini which I'd recommit you like to drink your desert! The space is beautiful and all the people working are super friendly. I can see this place become one of my regular hangouts.","Amy J.","We are staying at the Lowes hotel and were looking for dinner options... took a walk and saw PIZZA in lights on the corner. Expectations were exceeded. Alexandria the sommelier was welcoming, friendly and spot on with her recommendations. Pizza was DELish and the atmosphere was very relaxed. We will be back for more... Highly recommend! This overall experience really made our night complete.","Lulu M.","I love this new place my neighborhood. Cozy, intimate atmosphere, great service, and the food is incredible. Large squares of Roman-style pizza are delicious - chewy and a bit crunchy crust piled high with unique, yummy toppings. We haven't tried one that we didn't love, and have tried them all. One of my very favorite places!","Regan P.","I was excited to go here but pretty disappointed by the experience. The food was lackluster, oddly flavored and overpriced. And the space and service have a lot of kinks to work out. Both me and the people I ate with agreed we would not recommend this space or return. I love the other Hitchcock spots, but this is one to skip.","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"Phoenecia","https://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenecia-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tasha J.","I'm loving the new West Seattle location! This was a great spot to meet with girlfriends. They have a nice wine selection by the glass and bottle. On this visit we sat at a high top table between the bar and the dining room seating. This was a nice location and we felt like we were in a good place to laugh and be loud without bothering anyone.
We ordered the Saffron Chicken and Burratta as appetizers and the sauce on the chicken was so good that I was putting it on the crustini from the cheese! Absolutely great flavor. Both appetizers were a good size for sharing but def left you wanting more.
We ordered two pizzas to go along with our two bottles of wine as well. The Fig and Pancetta Pizza was awesome. I love how the crust is both crispy and chewy and the flavors meshed together well. I was super full by the time the Prosciutto de Parma Pizza came out but I was told this was fantastic as well!
Enjoy having another awesome place to hit in West Seattle!","Dianna N.","Prosciutto de Parma Pizza $19: I got hit with a craving for prosciutto pizza on my way home from work, so decided to try this place for takeout. My pizza took about 15 minutes. I measured it when when I got home and it's not a perfect circle, but it was about 10 inches in diameter. My appetite is generally on the smaller side, but I was full after eating this on my own. It wasn't the best prosciutto pizza I've had (that is still Archive Bar & Kitchen in San Francisco) but it was good enough and hit the spot. I didn't taste the olive oil on it, so at home I did dip the crust in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
I do want to come try to dine in sometime to try other items and their yummy looking cocktails!
Update: I have since returned to dine in for a date night and had a great time!
The Phoenician $14: Really likes this drink, it had the right amount of tartness. It went down so easy I could have drank it in one gulp but forced myself to make it last throughout dinner.
Nightshade $13: I normally don't like the drinks my boyfriend orders because the alcohol is too strong for me, but I didn't mind this one! Still not something I would order for myself, but it was pretty smooth.
Burrata $17: A tasty appetizer. The grilled bread was so good! Buttery and the perfect texture to enjoy with the cheese.
Lamb Chop Lollipops $16: The first bite was good and I could taste that garlic-y butter. After that, I either got used to the flavor or it faded because it was a little bit on the bland side. Texture was good, but I personally felt it was missing a tiny pinch of salt.
The Alki $19: The crust was good like last time. Crispy but not burnt. The right amount of chewiness. I did request oil and balsamic vinegar at the restaurant to dip the crust. Flavor wise I would pick the Prosciutto de Parma over this one. I do eventually want to try their pepperoni and Margherita pizza as well.
Tiramisu Cocktail $13: It reminded me of a White Russian, and I love those!
Nutella Cheesecake $9: I'm normally not into chocolate cheesecakes or cakes because I find them too rich. I was willing to give this a try because Nutella and it was tasty! The cheesecake was dense but not overwhelmingly sweet. I didn't really taste any hint of biscotti liquor in the whipped cream though.
Turkish Affogato $8: The coffee comes on the side so you can pour it over yourself. We accidentally put too much coffee on it so the ice cream melted pretty quickly. There was still enough coffee leftover after that to drink some on its own, so it's almost a 2 for 1 deal.

My Star Ratings:
1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry.
2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return.
3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to.
4 Stars - Yummy! Will definitely return if I haven't already.
5 Stars - AMAZING!!! Would plan my day or even a trip around eating here.","Ethan G.","Came to Phoenecia on a Friday night to grab some dinner and check it out. It maintains a similar vibe to the previous bar which was in the location before, Alchemy. It's ambiance is dimly lit, suave, and perfect for a date night. The service is great and everyone was extremely warm and welcoming, and the cocktails were tasty.
On the food front (the whole reason we came), was where I was disappointed. Simply put - the food is overpriced for what it is. The trio of dips was alright, and the labneh was the standout from a pretty standard lineup. The garlic green beans were the most surprising example of how overpriced I believe the food to be here. The pizza was good, although not memorable compared to other slices you can get even a few blocks down in West Seattle.
Overall, I'd come here again if I was just getting a cocktail - but I wouldn't come back for dinner.","Dhanashree A.","They are back! I am so glad they reopened. I was really sad when they closed so yay! We went here to celebrate our engagement anniversary.
It remains one of my favorite places in Seattle. The new location is very cozy. I really liked the decor. I thought the tables might be more spaced out but it's a minor thing. The service is wonderful as always. Our server was witty and attentive. He was also super generous with the wine. We got to try some options before we chose what we wanted. He made our evening really enjoyable.
Their scallops are the best I have ever tried. I love everything about them. The sear is perfect, the cook is awesome and the flavor is mind blowing! We also got their saffron chicken and margarita pizza. I really enjoyed both. The pizza has fresh tomatoes which are wonderful to eat.
We'll keep coming back. I have always celebrated special occasions here and this place is close to my heart!","Grace C.","Favorite date spot that I've been to. We ordered the fig salad, pizza and the lamb shank.
The fig salad may look small but it is not to be messed with. Super flavorful and we demolished it in seconds. The figs were juicy and went so well with the arugula.
The pizza was also pretty good- you can't mess up pizza. But really the star of the show was the lamb shank. With a hefty price tag- I cannot emphasize how great this dish was. Our waiter told us that the lamb shank is the only thing the original owner still makes and man is it good. The meat just falls off the bone. It's so flavorful and juicy and overall drool worthy.
The cocktails were really good as well! Very refreshing. The waiters have a good idea of what to recommend to you so I wold go with that.
Overall- GO HERE!! you will not regret it. 10/10 be back again.","Rick K.","We so happy to have Phoenecia open again. The new setting is beautiful, warm and so comfortable. The food was excellent and we were taken care of with such genuine hospitality. To see Inaam, and her daughters Nadia and Sonya was truly so enjoyable.
Jeffrey also was excellent as he was our waiter. We will be back very soon. Thank you for being in West Seattle.","Amy B.","Simply superb -- as always. They've moved to the top of the hill, but their Middle Eastern cuisine is as delectable as ever.
Hussein would be so incredibly proud of his children! They took the strong foundation he left to them so many years ago, and improved upon his dishes in every way!","Jorge D.","After waiting for a new location to open and since they had great reviews at their old location, my wife was eagerly waiting. Living in the Junction and being a block away, we really wanted to like it. Unfortunately we were both very disappointed.
The menu is definitely limited, we ordered the small plates and a Pizza.
I think if you are a Lebanese restaurant the hummus plate should be free or less expensive they served 6 small slices of Pita with 3 little dips $13.00 then ordered the lamb chops one bite for each with no flavor.They do not have a happy hour so the average drinks are $14.00 and small, Beer is a 12oz glass not even a pint as mostly all restaurants in Junction serve, Entrees are all $$$$ no choices and small portions.
So we ordered a Pizza and compared to other places in the junction the pizza has a lot to be desired.
We asked the server for a box for 3 slices of pizza and the bill and we were in shocked when he returned with a black (doggie) bag and the pizza wrapped in foil paper, for the amount they charged on the Entrees and the fine dinning they advertised they can afford a simple box for customer to take their leftovers.It looked like a dog Poop bag!!!.
We will not be returning is a shame because we are locals and we were hoping this restaurant would have been a success.","Sarah T.","The cocktails were delicious and the food was good. The pizza seemed a bit random, but was way better than we expected. The dough was really good. It was a bit pricy, but the ambiance was great.","Tessa C.","Great place for girls night! We came here to celebrate a friends birthday and had a wonderful time!
We had wine, appetizers eventually a pizza and everything was delicious!
The service was also fantastic! Our server was Jeffrey and he was helpful, fun, and provided the perfect amount of attention - I'd hope to have him as my server again. We finished the night off with the Turkish affagato which was incredible. Finally, love the atmosphere - a little dark and moody - the perfect amount for a fun or romantic night.","Josh G.","I am always nervous that the new won't compare to the old. In this case, way to step it up. Dinner and service were both insanely perfect. Parking was a challenge, but worth it!","Maggie S.","I had the opportunity to try the fiery lamb pizza and am so impressed by it! It was full of spice and flavor simultaneously. Would most certainly recommend checking this place out as they have food that exceeds expectations, especially for pizza. There are very few great pizza places in west Seattle and this is definitely one of them!","Jeska C.","This was our first time here and enjoyed the ambiance and food. Had no idea what to expect and were pleased with everything. I felt like most of the staff had stopped by our table to chat and they were all genuine and friendly. Thanks for a wonderful experience.","Thoma T.","Atmosphere 5/5
Food 5/5
Dessert 5/5
What a gem in the heart of west Seattle. It's located at the old alchemy. When you walk in you are immediately greeted by a group of very friendly staff member, this was the first time I came here and I immediately felt like I was a regular. The food was all amazing, we started with the fiery scallops and burrata- both were amazing. I am typically skeptical about pizza at small plates restaurants, but was pleasantly surprised. The crust was baked with a crispy exterior and a nice warm fluffy interior and the toppings were all cooked to perfection. We finished our meal with a light and fragrant Turkish affogato and my girlfriend had super crispy and fluffy baklava served with rose ice cream.
I will definitely be returning here again very soon. Without a doubt this restaurant has earn a spot in my heart as one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Washington State.","Michael A.","Absolutely love this restaurant. When I moved from VA to Seattle couple of years back, I was looking for a local place that can offer friendly and professional staff with really homemade delicious food. I became a fan once I tried their food and pizza. Nadia always made me feel at home with her beautiful smile and wonderful service. Few months ago we went to the old address across from Alki beach and it was closed. I was so disappointed. I'm happy to say they Re-opened the brand new restaurant at new address 4717 42nd Avenue SW, west Seattle. I am going to try the new location very soon I have heard it's going strong with even better selection-cannot wait! This became a place of distinct flavors, experiences and memories for me since I have been here in Seattle.
The best part about the experience, in addition to the fresh and deliciously prepared food, is the family that owns the restaurant. They have a special gift and make you feel like you are part of their family. This is what makes Phoenicia truly extraordinary and like no other place in the junction or West Seattle.
I had the safron chicken and artesian pizza's, such as butternut squash; fiery lamb and chèvre; and my favorite truffle oil and mushrooms. Also try their handcrafted cocktails. You won't be disappointed.","Christine V.","It was crowded. It was around 8pm. I needed pizza. This spot was packed and looked gourmet.
Ordered the proscuitto and arugula pie. Wow! Light doughy crust and just delicious. Thank you.","Jovana E.","Phoenicia has reopened and it is better than ever! My husband and I went last night with two friends and had a lovely dinner of delicious specialties. We had a combination of the true and tried favorites like the safron chicken and butternut squash pizza, and also some of the new menu additions, like handcrafted cocktails and a tasty seafood meddley known as the jewel of the ocean.

Nadia the owner also gave a personal touch to many of the items in the restaurant herself because she strived for perfection every step of the way. This makes the ambience that much more special to enjoy! I wholeheartedly recommend this place and plan to visit often.","Deborah G.","I was sooooo disappointed. Tiny portions, higher than high prices, rush you out the door. There is no way they deserve all the love they are getting. Would never go back.","Sarah G.","My work had our Holiday Party at Phoenicia last night, and it was amazing. The new location is wonderful with lots of parking across the street. The space is exotic and elegant, and the food was perfect. The service was a 10. I plan to go back for date nights and girls nights! Definitely check out the new location, you won't be disappointed.","Michele M.","Love this place and family ... my favorite place to eat casually or for a special event."
"Luigi’s Italian Eatery","https://www.yelp.com/biz/luigis-italian-eatery-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Song K.","Great experience for a great price.
I don't know where to start!
Immediately, we felt at home and welcomed as it was our first time here. My friend was from Spain visiting and she has been to Italy many times. She couldn't stop talking about this fun and decadent experience after it was all over. We will definitely be back!!
The delight of the experience is that you don't know what's coming out but you can tell them what you prefer. The courses that came out were so amazingly good and unique in flavors to one another that it kept our pallets dancing and guessing our next adventurous bite.
The service was very attentive and warm. I'm pretty needy when it comes to water refills FYI and I was never left thirsty. They explained each meal as it arrived and the whole experience was a delight! Thank you so much!!
We mistakenly stuffed our faces on the first 2 courses so we got so full by the time the main course arrived. It was so good!! They packed the left overs in to go containers very well and made it easy for us to enjoy it later. Thank you!!","Mike B.","No one was in. It is a strange atmosphere. Like someone's living room, or a restaurant that has recently closed. Papers scattered over the big desk right when you walk in and really old scratched glass wear from years of stacking.
Service was pretty nice
Food was not good this time. The garlic was so burnt on the carbonara I couldn't eat it. Pancetta seemed a bit old too. The owner asked if I wanted it remade which is cool, but I didn't feel like having anymore of that rich dish again. We got sick to our stomachs after eating the margarita pizza. All night. On New Year's Eve. It just seemed like the ingredients were cheap or stale. Garlic bread was cheap. For $2 a serving tho what can I expect.
Place needs an overhaul","Liz L.","Excellent food! I wandered in this restaurant and was a bit skeptical. As others have noted, the hostess, was sitting a table that had paperwork and iced coffee cups, but I hadn't eaten all day and decided to stay. Be warned, this place is no nouvelle cuisine...they do not have signature cocktails or cocktail menu....rather it's like eating in someone's home..they offer what they have. That being said, the food was amazing. The salad was fresh with homemade dressing, large enough for two! My entree, was huge and the pasta was cooked to al dente perfection! The chicken parmigiana was one of the best I've ever had.
If you want excellent food this is your place. If you want upscale restaurant trappings go somewhere else.","Saffron S.","Luigi's Italian Eatery was the best! The atmosphere is very Italian, homey, and comfortable. The service was very knowledgeable about menu and wines, super nice, and very accommodating.
The food was great! My group all got different dishes, and I would've ordered each of them. To order, I got the Caesar salad, bruschetta, and the gnocchi sorrentina. HUGE helpings! The salad was huge, definitely could've split it with a partner. You'll have plenty of pasta left overs.","Diana R.","I took a cooking class from Rosanna. She was amazing and the food came out great. There were 7 people total in the class. We made salad, pasta with Italian bacon and tomato sauce, baked cauliflower with a cheese sauce, chicken piccata, and tiramisu. It was very tasty and easy to make. It was fun meeting new people. A wonderful experience. I will come back!","Chloe P.","Excellent service and excellent food! Went for lunch with my family and we all loved our dishes. I got a Gnocchi fish, everyone's else got some sort of sandwich. The owner was very attentive and friendly and I would highly recommend!","Cara L.","It's been a while since we've stopped in to this local, Italian restaurant. And I feel like it honestly might be my last time, unfortunately.
I'm at 2.5 stars right now. It sucks because I really want to like this place so much. And it isn't that the food is terrible, either. The portions can be on the small side, but their cream-based pastas and their carbonara are consistently good. However, about half of their menu items are hit or miss.
We stopped in recently on a Saturday afternoon to grab a late lunch and the place was pretty empty. We were seated at a table that had water all over it from the pitcher there for us to refill. Menus were placed on our table and we were asked right away if we wanted drinks. We asked for a drink menu and the waiter told us he ""was the drink menu."" Okay? How am I supposed to know what to order if you have no indication of what cocktails, wine, and beer you offer? I asked for a red wine and so did my fiance. The waiter then immediately asked us if we were planning on having more than one glass and if we wanted a carafe instead. We stupidly said yes without any mention of price or size. $32 later for house wine and I'm a little pissed that there was no mention of price from the waiter after he offered, ESPECIALLY since they have no drink menu.
We then ordered our food and while we waited, we noticed the the staff was sitting around for 75% of the time we were there. It seems weird that a restaurant's staff would just be chillin' on a Saturday. Any restaurant or bar I've ever worked in there was ALWAYS something to do and there was NEVER a reason to be sitting around. When our food was dropped off, I was bummed that my ragu was bland. But my fiance liked his carbonara.
When we got our check I was shocked to see that 1) a carafe of house wine is $32 and they don't tell you that and 2) there is a 20% SERVICE CHARGE. And not just for large parties, but even for 2 people dining--no matter how the service you received was, or how the food was... I'm not kidding. There is no signage or warning of this anywhere in the restaurant that I saw. As someone who worked in the service industry from a long time, I'm a big tipper. But what they're doing here at Luigi's is absolutely unacceptable.
It's because of this I will not return.","Maria C.","Super fun to diner at Luigi's! I'm from Italian descent and this made it on my scale. Everyone was super friendly. I got the margarita and the fresh mozzarella brought the whole dish to life. Yum! Thank you Luigi's.","Christian S.","Loved the chicken Parmigiana and the vegetable medley, homey atmosphere that is separate from the noise of Seattle. Will come back again","Sebastian T.","I came here as I had an opportunity to try the margherita pizza with mealpal. This restaurant is actually a venue that teaches cooking classes as well! I came in at 1:30pm on a weekday and there was noone in the restaurant and the owners were sitting at one of the tables, and planning out the cooking classes for later in the day.
The margherita pizza was really meh. The cheese to crust ratio was off, there was simply too much. Additionally, there was a fair bit of italian seasoning in the crust/under the cheese that threw me off, but overall it contributed to the dish. But this did turn out way too oily, probably due to the excessive amount of cheese. The cheese ended up flowing between each slice of the pizza where it was cut, if that paints a picture.
I'd come back and try the pasta dishes one day, but i'll definitely be avoiding the pizza in the future. I recommend coming here at least once to check it out! It has a warm family owned welcoming vibe.","Harpreet K.","DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE RUDE AND SHITTY SERVICE
We were craving for some pasta and saw that this was the closest one at walking distance in pioneer square. I would give this place a 0 if I could.
We were seated by an older woman who looked like might own the place given by her terrible and careless attitude. As you enter, there is no signage or check in booth, so you are left wondering how far deep you have to go into the restaurant to ask for help. We walk in a few steps and the owner gets up from a dining table similar to one that someone would keep at home - and comes up to us and ask us to be seated. The dining table was a mess, it looked like her office. There was a laptop, a couple of Starbucks cups and a stack of paperwork. We were sat right next to her table. And opposite from her - what seemed like her home office desk - was a mini bar. LOL - it was basically a buffet with a bunch of bottles of alcohol sitting there.
We sat down and were asked right away if we wanted anything to drink besides water. We asked for a drink menu and the owner said that she didn't have one ... we asked her to give us a few minutes. And when she came back we were still confused so we ended up not ordering a drink.
Our water glasses were FILTHY! We even told her that we would like a new glass, she kept telling us that "" they're not dirty, we just stack them on top of each other "" ok - the glass was literally cracked on the inside, it's like when you scrape a piece of glass against something and there is some debris coming off from it .. we then told her "" ok, can we still get a replacement glass "" she just made her way out - this was after taking our order. Her attitude was terrible that we ended up getting up and walking out of there!
What really irritated me was that she didn't care that we asked for a new glass to drink out of - or had a drink menu for us to choose from , and with her filthy attitude - they have the audacity to charge a 20% gratuity! No ma'am , I used to be a server and I got tipped for my service. And this place did not deserve a single dime.
I will not be returning. We didn't even get a chance to try the food, but the way you treat your customers is what matters most! I am surprised that they haven't gone out of business yet - it's just a waste of space in pioneer square.","Jen G.","Nice and quiet for lunch while we waited for our verdict. My companions who had the caprese salads were very satisfied and those of us who ate the Risotto enjoyed it. I would like to come back here to try the rest of the menu.","Sarah E.","We went to their cooking class/dinner. The instructor was pleasant and knowledgeable and the food that we prepared (very hands on) was good but the menu was nothing like the examples online and the instructor was not the restaurants chef as advertised.
We used a groupon for the class and then had to pay additional the night of for taxes and gratuity (for the restaurant staff not the instructor). Very odd. The woman (owner? Manager?) that was checking us in was unusual, slightly rude.
I don't think we will be back to this restaurant in pioneer square and with so many choices in Seattle it's not somewhere we'd recommend.","Bill T.","This one is a bit of a head scratcher. The ratings on Yelp are very high, but our actual experience was more in the 2 to 2.5 star range.
Came here on a Saturday night and it was fairly busy but had a few empty tables. Once we were acknowledged by someone, they said we'd have a table in a few minutes and we did. The guy who took our order was nice and we made it simple...two salads and three spaghetti and meatballs (Polpette). Watching the other tables, it seemed like each one had a wrong order delivered. The table right next two us asked for the check before they got their food because they'd been waiting so long and then when the food came, it was wrong (although the correct food came out quickly).
Our spaghetti and meatballs came out quickly. Unfortunately, we hadn't received any salads so we asked about those. The guy who delivered the food asked what we had ordered and he went to check. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was decent, though a bit bland. I'll be honest that I didn't care for the meatballs as they were filled with raisins and pine nuts. Just not a fan of that texture so I just ate the pasta.
A server comes back to check on us and we ask about the salads again. Then we ask if we can have some garlic bread. We did receive some garlic bread (which was not the style I like, very toasted with lots of garlic and butter...this was barely heated with just a bit of garlic) but still no salad. At that point, the server asks if we still want the salads since we are almost finished the meal and we just said we wanted one of them. We finally got that and it was okay.
The bill came quickly and we paid and left. It was just an odd place. There were two ""manager"" types (an older man and woman) who seemed to be fussing around at the ""desk"" by the front door but the servers were really hustling. Just seemed nobody was communicating with one another. As I didn't care for the style of food that was served, I would not return. Not a very welcoming or organized place, based on my experience.","Kurt F.","This place is an homage to the original owner who sadly passed last year. He was quite the character but his vision for authentic Italian fare at a fair price has lived on. It's what you would consider a mom and pop kind of place, small, but eclectically well appointed. The food is truly amazing. They have gluten free options as well and the seafood comes fresh from Pike Place down the street. Perfect for lunch or dinner. Service charge/tip included in the bill FYI. Great staff!","Sophia H.","The food was amazing and had a very good pasta selection. Many other dishes were available and at a reasonable price. The atmosphere and staff was friendly. It felt very authentic. Not to mention the food was made from scratch and could be modified without an issue. They have a good selection of desserts as well. Highly recommend especially if you have kids.","Jeffrey P.","If you are looking for an authentic Italian experience this is the place to go. I went here wIth a couple of my friends for lunch and was greeted by a very kind lady. Service was good and the people were very friendly. The place is unique and may not appeal to everyone but I certainly enjoyed myself. Food is also above and beyond, some of the best Italian food I've had. Would definitely recommend this place.","Jimmy B.","Came in with some out of town friends who were staying nearby.
Located in heart of Pioneer Square, Luigi's offers your standard Italian menu in a funky little restaurant. They also offer their own ""mix"" of Italian favorites, from soup to nuts for a single price per person.
Although it was good, I just can't say it's better than any other Italian local restaurant, with free parking.
Kudos for a fun evening, but I won't be back.","Mandy M.","There is a hand written note inside the menu that says: ""20% service charge has been added""
I thought the wording and grammar means (present perfect) it is in the price already.
I was surprised to see that our bill came to $90 and it was an incredibly bad meal. Pizza swimming in grease, terrible lasagna and a suspiciously light tasting glass of red wine and one tiny appetizer.
I asked about why the note didn't say: ""... will be added"".
The owner was rude and said there is nothing wrong with the wording, and no one had ever mentioned it!! Well, then he never read his yelp reviews because 1 out of 3 reviews do mention it - as a surprise and as a disappointment.
1 star is a lot when (did I mention the service was rude and the water was lukewarm tap water? - which is kind of an oxymoron)
- the food is horrible
- the prices are high
- the portions are small
- the 20% tip is mandatory
We tried to order food that's hard to screw up. ""We"" failed. The only thing that didn't fail that night was taking our payment.","Michael M.","Been here twice and ordered the pesto chicken pasta both times. Tonight was my second time, and I experienced a mild euphoria from my meal. It's a pretty casual, warm, and homey setting. The staff are super nice. I've seen the bad reviews, which is kind of confusing. It is a little quirky, but that's why I like it. It might be different if the pesto pasta wasn't so good."
"Agrodolce","https://www.yelp.com/biz/agrodolce-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Wellington A.","First time at this place and definitely not the last. Must orders, caramelized broccoli, lamb burger with the potatoes well done. The value for the bottomless mimosa is excellent. Overall 5 star","Paulina H.","How to start writing review for this restaurant? I don't even know how to describe it. I ordered carbonara, first of all it's not the traditional carbonara, it's weird to use this type of pasta, there were some water left in the pasta and made my dish very watery, I am glad they made it al dente, but there was no flavor at all. On the other hand, the bacon is full with flavor, I personally loved it but it's so greasy and did not mix well with the pasta. It is kinda of awkward to eat this dish, so be prepared to eat it with forks and knife. My friend ordered the same dish, he has the same opinion.
The homemade tiramisu is okay, It's also not traditional tiramisu that tastes like coffee, it tasted citrus instead,I could not taste the coffee, the cake a little dry, and it's too sweet!
The environment is pretty nice and there's a cute tree in the middle.
I would not recommend this place but I didn't try other dishes, so I only rated this restaurant based on the dishes I ordered.
Food:4/10
Service: 10/10
Environment: 10/10","Tim G.","My wife and I met up with friends at Agrodolce for Seattle Restaurant Week. We started with a bottle of wine that was a little too acidic. After 30 minutes our appetizers showed up. Two of us ordered the mushroom arancini. It said foraged and found mushrooms. I guess the foraging didn't go well, because we didn't find any mushroom flavor. My wife ordered the local roots beet salad. They brought her the arancini as well and did not seem to believe her when she said she had ordered the beet salad. We all heard her say it. I am not sure why the waiter did not. Another twenty minutes and her salad showed up.
My wife enjoyed her salad. After another 30 minutes the entrees were served. My Braised Lamb was quite good. My wife's choice Bucatini Sarde was not bad. The other two in our party had the Chestnut Rigatoni. It was flavorless and the gluten free pasta was quite awful. They did not ask for gluten free pasta, that is all that was offered with the dish.
For dessert, three of us had the Theo's Chocolate Caramel Budino, which was very tasty, but served with a tablespoon that was larger than the ramekin.
In the two hours we were there, the waiter only spoke to us to take the original order, doubt that my wife had ordered the beet salad and mumble thanks when he dropped off the bill. Was it because we spoke Spanish or because of the order mixup? No, he seemed to be that way with everyone. He clearly did not want to be there. No problem, the place was half empty on restaurant week. We won't be back again. Soon enough he'll likely have his wish and not have to be there anymore.","Amandeep S.","Just had lunch here for a work meeting - it's a cute place with a patio and the seating by the window is cozy with pillows and soft seats. But I'm overall not that impressed.
The service was really slow even though there were barely anyone in for lunch, and in the two hours we were there our server didn't ask about the food once. We had to wait for while for our food too, and when he came back it was only to refill our waters and give us the check.
In terms of food, I had the daily special salad, which had an arugula and red cabbage base with almonds, figs, burrata cheese and grilled chicken (added for $4 more). I thought this was a very innovative salad and liked it very much - the only thing I was missing was a little more acidity from the dressing. I think they should have added a bit more of that. My chicken was also good but a little burnt, and they used chicken breast that wasn't boneless, so there was less meat than it looked like.
I wasn't able to take a proper look at the rest of the menu since we ordered rather quickly (the server came back very fast and my coworkers that had been there before us already knew what they wanted), so I might come back to sample that since I love Italian food. But it won't be my first pick.","Elyse M.","I came here with a friend because she was trying to use a gift $50 gift card before leaving the area.
We arrived right as they opened and no one was in the restaurant besides us for the first 15 to 30 minutes we were there. The waitress took a while to take our order and the food took a bit longer than I'd expect given that no one else was there.
I ordered a smaller pasta for $16, my friend ordered a larger pasta plate, and we ordered focaccia with oil to reach that $50 mark.
The food was good. The olive oil had a little too much salt in it but it tasted good besides that. I couldn't really taste the pasta but the sauce was flavorful.
The portion size to price ratio is ridiculous and I would say not worth it. We did ask what the sizes were before ordering so we had a vague sense of how much we were getting. The waitress said the smaller portion was for sampling while the larger one was more of a meal. For $16 I hope you'd get more than a sample, and normally wouldn't have gone for that option, but we were trying to use the gift card, so we bought more.
When the bill came, my friend tried using the gift card and was told that the restaurant couldn't accept it because management had changed a couple months before and my friend would have to use it at (I think) Tilth.
The waitress was nice about it but the response on behalf of the restaurant seems unprofessional. There was no notice anywhere about the change in management or that the gift cards couldn't be used here. I would assume I would be able to use a gift card with the restaurant's name on it at the restaurant without having to check if it's a valid form of payment. I feel like good customer service would have been to accept the gift card and notify us for next time, especially since we bought what we did because of the gift card. This can all be chalked up to lack of communication, but as customers, this doesn't seem like a thing you'd normally have to communicate.","Isabela M.","We live right by Agrodolce and it has become our go-to date night spot. The ambiance is lovely and the staff is super friendly and professional. We're big fans of their pastas, highly recommend!","Erik S.","Like other reviews say, we had a really bad thanksgiving dinner experience. They forgot our salad, service was slow (we asked if they were understaffed and they said they were not), and portions/quality were not worth the price. The tables next to us we're both so frustrated that it made for a really bad dining experience, despite us trying to make the most of it. One table even yelled when our food arrived because they were still waiting... and they ended up getting up and leaving without paying with permission from the waiter. The waiter offered us two free glasses of wine and even ended the night by saying ""sorry we ruined your holiday""... I wouldn't have gone that far, but apparently that's how clear the experience was. Feels wrong to charge full price for an experience that apparently ruined our thanksgiving.","Joseph J.","This place is a scam, and our experience was a disaster.
1. Tiny portion for the price we paid
2. Waited for almost 90mins after ordering, even though the place (I wouldn't call it a restaurant) is only about 20% full. It feels like the server is also the cook? I don't know, but I am pretty sure it would take me less time to buy the ingredients from the PCC across street and cook the dish myself.
3. The pasta tasted like yakisoba from next door, but this place charge you triple.
4. We got tricked into ordering soup/salad. Yes, there was the fine print about how much the soup/salad cost, but the way Kurt the server asked made it sounds like it was a combo that come with the pasta.
5. Kurt the sever charged us extra, both in the item price and in tax (he charged the tax based on subtotal+tips). He know we are in a rush to get back to work. The seasonal pasta got charged $1 more, and the spaghetti marinara got charged $4 more. What a scam.
6. I would like to say something to Kurt the server, but due to the general guideline of Yelp, I am not gonna say it here.
7. I hope this place get closed, so there won't be more victims from their scam.
In conclusion, come to this place if you like any of the following:
1. waste of time
2. hunger
3. being scammed
4. disaster
5. get charged unreasonably","Andrew W.","Come hungry, leave hangry.
Today is Mother's day, and so I defer to my wife for a review of our Mother's Day pick.
It was a Prix Fixe menu. 8 of us held a table for almost 2 and a half hours while we waited for the second course to show up. The food was cooked with varying degrees of quality. My wife was steamed. We won't be returning.
They waited until we'd already been put for 2 hours before they informed us that a cook hadn't showed. For that, I will leave the waiter with a tip:
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Tell us ahead of time so my wife doesn't flip out. (^_^)","L A.","Came here for thanksgiving... the only good thing about the meal was the company that I was with. The food was all cold. The salad had zero flavor. Some of the items had a strange after taste. One of the pre set dishes was no longer available. So they brought out soup instead. When I asked the waitress what kind it was, she was not sure and smelled it! The portions were extremely small and the sweet potatoes were under cooked. Everything took entirely too long to come out and when we received each course they were all slightly warm at best.
Aside from all of that, our waitress was extremely chatty and down right inappropriate. I won't get into what she said to me, but it was enough to offend me. At 115 dollars a person we all left hungry, disappointed, and I left offended. Over all this was the worst dinner experience of my 38 years of life.","Geri Ann B.","I usually love Agrodolce! But this was the first time with its executive chef Thomas Litrenta as owner - he bought the place from famed chef Maria Hines last month. It was one of my lunch picks for Seattle Restaurant Week Spring 2019. I arrived at 12:30pm, there were only six seated tables, more than a dozen open tables, yet I stood waiting at the front for almost five minutes. There was only one person managing front of house and table service, he needed help. Even though there were many wide open tables he said there might be a wait because it was Seattle Restaurant Week and they were holding a lot of tables (I note that no one else showed up after me, and lunch service ended at 2:00pm). Luckily he sat me anyway. The appetizer dish of grilled asparagus with pepper sauce and homemade burrata was the best appetizer of all SRW offerings I had during the week. I could have eaten three servings of it. The server/host recommended the tomato rigatoni entree and is was, sadly, very disappointing and downright not good. The sausage was overcooked and hard, the pasta might have been good but the texture was like it was overboiled and then sat under a heat lamp for too long, strangely tough on the surface even though mushy on the inside. Then as you reached the bottom, there was just too much oil/sausage fat pooled at the bottom of the dish to be appetizing.
I love this place normally, so it had to be an off day, but SRW should put better since I think the idea is to capture people who might not otherwise try a place. I'd hate to think that someone might think this was their best foot forward.","Geoff L.","Went there for Thanksgiving, the worst meal we have ever had. First, my wife told them she was a vegetarian in the reservations, to our waiter when we sat down after he asked and they still served salad with bacon on it. When she said something, the waiter said that is how it comes, they did take care of her after she looked at him and said I can't eat this. After almost 2 hours our turkey finally came, I thought my first bite was raw so I mentioned it to the couple that was with us. When one of them shined his cell phone light on it, it was raw. He called the waiter in and he took it back to the kitchen. They offered us another plate but we were already going on 2.5 hours. The sweet potatoes were crunchy too, not at all cooked. Since desert finally came after 2.5 hours after we got there, we took it in a box to go.
They did comp our dinner but it was the worst dinning experience I have ever had, will never go back.","Anna G.","My team and I had lunch today at Agrodolce and I would not recommend it. There were 12 or so of us and maybe 4 other people in the restaurant. We were greeted by the owner/chef/server....which was interesting.
Most of us ordered the house salad w/a protein. It took over an hour for our meals to arrive - we were there a total of 2. I found two human hairs in salad & two other attendee's also found hair in their entree's. Not only did we not receive an apology but our entree's were not taken off the final bill. Further, the food that was delivered without issues, was ok at best. Not sure if they were having an off day or what but I would not recommend this place.
Cute restaurant, no parking and food was below mediocre, it was not edible.","DarShanna S.","We went here for Thanksgiving. There was a prix fixe menu for the night. Food was not at all up to expectations. There was something wrong with every course. The pastry on the Caramelized onion tart was raw in the middle and under cooked. The pasta course had ZERO seasoning. We had to request salt to give it any flavor. The turkey roulade was COLD in the middle. The sweet potatoes needed a glaze or something - they were just cut into non-uniform sizes and under roasted, hard and not completely cooked. The cannoli were all different shapes and sizes - some big, some small; some undercooked, some overcooked. Spent over $300 for dinner for two (included drinks) on Thanksgiving and we were completely disappointed. Will not return.","Matthew C.","Had Thanksgiving dinner 2019 at Agrodolce. The window bench was cold and uncomfortable (why would you align the tables such that you have to seat between two cushions). The service was attentive (automatic 20 % tip added to the bill by the restaurant). Total for two people for the prix fixe menu with two glasses of wine ($13 each) came up to $228. The food was good, but in very little quantity. It was not worth the price. Thus my rating.","Andy Y.","I went here with my co-workers for our weekly lunch outing. The place didn't look too busy so we decided to eat here after our original lunch out location was too crowded. We ordered and we waited for almost an hour and a half. I ordered the seasonal pasta special and when it finally arrived I was disappointed that it tasted less like an italian dish and more like something you could buy from panda express for a third of the price. The portion size was not satisfactory. When we got the bill we were also pretty sad to see that the soup was not included as a combo with the meal adding insult to injury. I went in hungry, and left hungry with a savage hole in my wallet.
Turn around if you're thinking of trying this place for lunch.","Bernie W.","Had dinner at Agrodolce 7/20/2019. This was our first visit in many years. We had a woderful experience. The waiter at our table was very informative of the menu and helped us to make some good choices.
We started with the Caramelized Broccoli, toasted almond, chili flake, anchovy vinaigrette. This is a special of the house and it was excellent. The portion could have served 4....so we took home what we didn't eat.
For our entree we had the Squid Ink Chitarra, dungeness crab, preserved lemon, pickled pepper and bottarga. Very different and excellent.
Our second entree was Coffee Flour Pappardelle & Sugo....beef, pork, lamb, hourse marinara, mama lil's peppers....excellent. We shared some of each entree. Two very different flavors.
For desert we shared the Lemonchelo Tieramisue which we shared and was excellent.","April S.","This place has fallen from grace, change in ownership perhaps. Had a reservation for 6 and I wish they would have called me to let me know it was not a good day.... we were one of the only tables, and they did now allow any more tables because they were out of everything, their fryer was broken, I mean it was just a mess. The chicken was raw. Wouldn't blame the servers, not sure where to place blame... felt like an ownership issue. Will not return, which is sad considering this use to be one of my favorite and highly recommended places.","Allegra C.","I visited Agrodolce during Seattle Restaurant Week. The service was extremely slow, but I otherwise enjoyed the meal and would dine here again. I ate the roasted carrots, duck and mushroom pasta, and apple cake. All were extremely delicious - the type of food you slow down to enjoy.","Erin G.","This place has a lot of potential. It gives off the vibe of a very indulgent restaurant -- the pasta is freshly made and the menu is seasonal, so every visit will be different. However, it's a bit expensive, which might be why whenever I go it feels like we're one of two couples in the restaurant!
1 large pasta and 1 small pasta is a perfect portion to share for two people. The pasta is always delicious -- my first visit I felt I had the best bolognese of my life. You will want to also get an order of bread.. not only is it great, but it will help you clean up the last of your yummy pasta sauce.
All in all, would recommend a visit for a fancy and intimate dinner date."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-8?osq=Italian+Food","Vicki S.","I indulged in my favorite #MeatlessMonday favorites at MIOPOSTO for dinner tonight.
Their ""Le Patate Con Tartufo"" Pizza is made with roasted potatoes, fontina, gorgonzola, carmelized onions, thyme, red pepper flakes, and white truffle oil. It goes so well with their creamy and perfectly dressed Caesar Salad.
Who knew potato pizzas were a thing?!?! I didn't know until a few years ago when I first tried it here at Mioposto. Their version is simple, tasty, and crave-worthy. You'll be drooling for more!!!","Serena T.","I think it is a kid friendly place because all the tables around us are parents with their little ones. They bring crayons for kids.
It has a beautiful cozy inside, but part of it is because today happens to be a rare sunny day in the middle of January.
We ordered the baker and Shakshuka. Our latte tasted really good, and our dishes were delicious. This place is so tucked in, we had never thought about coming here before even though we used to live 5 minutes from it. I liked the food and the ambiance. Highly recommended.","Conor S.","Fantastic place to eat! Can't believe it took me so long to visit here. The staff was amazing. We sat at the bar and she was attentive but not pushy. Enjoyed a glass of red wine while my friends had a cocktail and beer. The roasted beet salad was yummy and I would recommend. The small salad was still generous enough for a pre meal taste.
As for pizza, even a picky eater can find something here. We had the Pepperoni Puntura and the Oliver's pizza. Wow! It really was all so good. I was impressed. Will be coming back. I need to try the lasagna.","Jennifer B.","The service was too unfriendly for me.
We use to get take out pizzas all the time. It was our go to place and it seemed like it would be every other week we would get takeout. I stopped going in because it was hard to get someone's attention to get your pizza. I would send my partner in instead because I was sick of the unhappy servers ignoring me.
The pizza crust would be burnt often times and there was a general lack of care. We got a salad a couple times but it wasn't the best.
For the price it wasn't worth going anymore. We've found other places to get pizzas.","David S.","Amazing food but even better service. Wendy was amazing and so funny. She checked on us and is super charasmatic. Definitely deserves a raise.","Lauren N.","4.5 stars
Wow- what a great spot to visit! My boyfriend and I were in Seattle and were able to walk to this spot from our AirBnB so we decided to check it out. This place gets busy so I recommend getting an app that can save you a spot in line which is what we did and showed up just in time after the dinner rush had finished. The venue is extremely cute/quaint, perfect for the ultimate date night- cool signage, unique hanging lights, lots of brick bordered by wood.
We started out with the recommended wine for the evening and were very happy with the decision- I could tell they knew their stuff in that regard. We split the oven-roasted clams which were amazingly buttery but with that slight brightness that the wine and parsley added. Would have liked a little more bread with it to soak up all the amazing juices but we definitely made do. We split the formosa for dinner which is a perfect go to classic pizza that would make anyone happy- the olives were a great touch of saltiness. Finished it off with a little bit of ice cream to sooth my sweet tooth and was perfectly content.
Basically the only reason I didn't give 5 full stars is that service was a little slow towards the end of our meal despite there not being that many patrons- might have been a little short staffed?
All in all, would love to come back to Seattle to try out their other unique pizzas!","Richard G.","The one star is far too good for them. Average food but the worst service in America. We came, as a group of 7 , and waited nearly an hour, until we realized they were never going to serve us. We were a group of drs and older and obviously not welcome.
The servers were at best nasty and unfriendly and should not be in this industry. There is no excuse for their behavior...
I cannot imagine how anyone could leave a tip.
Awhile later:
The owner/manager reached out to me and was very gracious. He reviewed my concerns and was very reassuring about addressing the matter in the future. So
I was very involved by his involvement.
For my part, I think I should be more careful about going to places with large groups:many restaurants cannot handle them without prior notice.","Brad H.","Fantastic happy hour. The Rosemary flat bread was my favorite- full of flavor and good serving size. Service was attentive and friendly despite being at full capacity. Highly recommend this great restaurant. Thank you also for your support of Strong Against Cancer/ Seattle Children's Hospital.","Katherine G.","Mioposto is my favorite pizza place in Seattle! Their happy hour is amazing and has a ton of options for food! It's definitely a treat to go to Mioposto because most places in Seattle haven't figured out how to make good wood fired pizza! Their wine is nice and so are their cocktails. I highly recommend Mioposto! :)","Mahsa S.","the pizza is absolutely delicious! I got the Quattro formaggi and the hint of lemon was a great touch. a bit on the pricey side but worth it. the pizzas are 12"" and could probably be split between two people if wanted, but if you're hungry enough it's good for one","B K.","While I adore Mioposto's food and atmosphere, there is one special reason I love to return: Wendy! If you haven't been blessed to encounter Wendy as your server you are missing the most magnificent, dynamic, friendly, and gregarious server ever! Wendy's charisma and utter joyfulness can turn a grey Seattle afternoon into a burst of pure radiant sunshine.
To me, this is the treasure of Mioposto.
When I leave the restaurant I have a satisfied tummy and a smile on my face!","Nikki H.","Finally got to check out Mioposto on a Tuesday night and so glad we did. It was busy and we were able to get the last table available. They have tons of vegetarian options which is always a plus in my book. Offer happy hour and parking isn't bad.
For A cocktail I ordered the lavender French 75, it was so refreshing and tasty. We started out with the Roasted Beet Salad that had different Lettuces, goat cheese and almonds. It was so good I wished that we ordered a bigger one! For pizza we chose the La Bianca which had shredded mozzarella, goat cheese, caramelized onion, garlic, chili flakes and fresh arugula. We were planning on only having a few slices but ended up eating the whole thing because it was so darn good!
Overall the food and service was great! The prices are on the higher end for the amount of food you get but I think it's worth it.","Helen T.","I try to eat 98% plant based (""vegan"") but this certainly did not fit that category. Mioposto did not have any specifically vegan options which was a little disappointing, they did say that I could request their vegetarian pizzas without cheese, but because I was on vacation in Seattle I decided to full send the cheese. I haven't broken my veganism often (only once before) over these past 4 years, but I'd say this cheese lasagna was (maybe) worth it. The sauce however was my favorite part, so maybe they could incorporate that into a vegan dish in the future. Really great atmosphere.","Brittani S.","Should definitely come and check out their lunch combo; a salad and a pizza for about $13, or during happy hour for discounted apps and entrees. Both deals for great for the quality and amount of food you get.","Melissa R.","We were so excited to try this place after reading the reviews, but sadly it fell short. We were there during a very busy time on Saturday night. We're really patient people, no issue with waiting, but you could tell the staff was bey overwhelmed with the volume of in house and to go orders.
We watched our pizza come out of the oven, by the time it was delivered it was cold. No exaggeration, cold. The middle of the pizza had also sogged up a bit from sitting.
The pizza was delicious. I can only imagine how much I would've been raving about this place had my food been warm. We might've sent it back, but by the time someone came to see how it was, we were hungry so had already eaten quite a bit.
We may give them another shot, but would definitely avoid that peak dinner time on the weekend.","Sydney S.","Happy hour was incredible! Fun atmosphere, delicious food, friendly staff. Highly recommend and I'll be back! Lamb pizza was unbelievable!!!!","Jen K.","I have been to Mioposto a fair number of times because we live close by. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for this restaurant, but I am happy to have it in the neighborhood as an easy, go-to, kid-pleaser type of place. The food is solid. If you are low carb you can get the eggplant Parmesan (it's also gluten free), and a side salad. Otherwise, people mostly come here for the pizzas. It can be hard to bring a group larger than 4-5 because it's a fairly small restaurant, but I was able to get a large table for a party of 8 one time, on the day of Husky game no less! I actually prefer Mioposto for brunch, because they have one of the best Bloody Marys in Seattle (and a pretty good Italian style frittata).","Clint W.","I think this is a hidden place and I liked it.
We made it for HH, had a great pizza with an egg on it. House red? Check. I thought the staff was friendly and she came by to let get a second round before HH expired.
Its pretty small, and definitely has a neighborhood vibe to it. But I am coming again.","Lauren R.","This is the best pizza I've ever had in the states, on par with Italian pizza. The pizzas are wood fired and fresh with amazing combinations. I believe we got the Prosciutto e Arugula and Le Patate Con Tartufo. I dream about this pizza! The service was excellent with our waiter being very friendly and attentive. The tiramisu was delicious as well!","Yang Y.","just read this

"Park Place","https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-place-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Phoebe K.","If you haven't checked this place out since it changed ownership 6 months ago, I highly recommend you head over and try it soon.
Yes, the Italian food is delicious, the view is great, the wine is awesome, but the warm service and hospitality is what truly shines at Park Place. Really, the service was perfect.
The new owners, Corona and Daniel, understand what it means to be warm and welcoming to guests, including families. When we walked in on a Saturday night, a party of seven (including my 18 month old daughter and my out-of-town parents), they treated us like gold. Just one example of their attentiveness: they noticed that my kid was saying ""hungry"" and we'd run out of snacks, so they rescued us by giving her a mini plate of plain pasta to snack on before the food came out.
The ambiance inside is kind of romantic with white tablecloths, but honestly I'd rather have sat outside for the view. (It was too cold.)
The Caesar salad were really good. I'd definitely get one for lunch if I was in the neighborhood.
I came back today for a coffee and ended up having a nice chat with Corona. He mentioned that they're able to make a lot of the entrees vegan on request, which interested me because I have a relative who is vegan. I know we'll be back because not only is the food great but the people are too.","Deborah G.","We went to Park Place for happy hour. The service was impeccable with 2 waiters meeting our every need. The atmosphere is warm and friendly. Three of us ordered the spaghetti Bolognese and the fourth ordered gnocchi. Everything was delicious including the 2 salads we shared. I highly recommend the restaurant. Give it a try soon!","Debbie J.","Stopped by after our original plans were altered by a power outage - really great risotto and service we awesome","Patty S.","Park Place now has new owners and the focus is on Italian food. As we live in the neighborhood, it has become a favorite. They serve good Italian food, nicely spiced. We were there recently and had the Pasta de Casa and the risotto special, which featured fresh chanterelles and prawns. Both dishes were delicious and the serving size perfect. The only issue that I had was related to the spotty service. It was a Saturday evening and they were very busy. They had lots of employees working but, perhaps they were new to restaurant service. We enjoy Park Place and the atmosphere and will return. Hopefully, their service will improve.","Fariba R.","Excellent food. Liked the ambiance. Service was great. Our friends enjoyed it and said they will go back.","Jen D.","Love this place! Veal Parmesan was so tender and delicious. Tiramisu was amazing! We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the people watching while dining. The service was great too. We will be back.","Jim S.","Great wine. Great service. Very good food. Can't beat the view. We had happy hour food and drinks in the upstairs bar. It was a lovely evening. The gnocchi was especially good.","T C.","Didn't get to eat here. Showed up on mother's day for our early dinner reservation with my two children. Had a $150 gift card we purchased at our Seattle United Soccer Club auction. Hostess said owner wouldn't honor the gift card, that ownership had changed.
Really?
Disappointing....we drove down from North Seattle for a nice dinner by the lake..
I didn't want to make a scene on that day w my kids. We went next door and had a great meal w the same view, thanks McGilvras!!","Melissa R.","We had dinner at Park Place for the first time last night. We had been away all summer and we're looking forward to trying it after talking to the new owners, while walking our dog.
We received a wonderful reception upon arrival and continued to receive perfect service and delicious food. My husband had the veal saltimboca, and I had the pasta bolognese. Both were as good as you can get. Perfectly prepared and perfect portions. We had the tiramisu for dessert which was also just right. Great wines as well. We'll be back. We welcomed the pricing; it's nice to feel as though you haven't been had.","Joey J.","The food here can be either really good or just okay. The clams with chorizo was a giant portion and had good flavor but the grilled bread served with it was burnt. The arugula salad was bland and needed a bit more dressing. The sausage pasta was good albeit a bit too creamy. The fish of the day, halibut, was very good. I'd give the food a 4-4.5 star range. Portions were large so it negates the semi high price point.
Our biggest gripe was the service. We were seated and immediately given water and the menus. It took us about twenty minutes to be able to put in our food order. When the server finally asked us if we were ready, we had to ask if there were specials (which there were). I requested a drink that they didn't have an ingredient for, which was completely understandable, but then that caused an additional ten minute delay to get our drinks. Service was so slow/off that we decided against a bottle of wine because we saw a neighboring table pouring their own glasses and don't think that's acceptable for a semi-empty restaurant charging the prices they are with the ambiance they are trying to provide. Service improved towards the end but it was an issue to the point where it played into our beverage choice. $200 all in for a two person dinner and you just expect a bit more.","Marsia A.","The food is amazing and so is the view! If you want a romantic get away this is the spot! I would also make a reservation due to how busy the place is. The pesto is delicious!","Cameron E.","Stunning contrasts - great view and great appetizers, but the service was almost comically bad and the mains were nothing to write home about.
Came here since it's a neighborhood restaurant for us, and we were really excited about the new opening under new ownership. Made an easy reservation with OpenTable and were shown immediately to a table on the front stoop. The host promised ""we'll be by shortly with waters.""
No waters appeared, but after some delay, a server showed up, noting ""oh, I'll be by with some waters in just a sec."" Five minutes later, she comes back to ask if we had menu questions, no waters in hand.
Finally get the waters and appetizers are in. She walked off without even taking a drink order - so I had to flag her down and order a glass of wine. It mean, it was comically bad that she didn't even ask if any one at the table wanted anything to drink, or wanted drinks before appetizers.
When the apps finally showed up, they were pretty good; we had the calamari that was sautéed with capers and olives, and a prosciutto with melon and arugula. While the portions were off in the latter (too much meat, too little melon) it was good, and we thought the squid was done pretty well with good balance of flavors.
After finally enjoying the apps, we were getting hungry for mains. Too bad the server was nowhere to be found... we flagged her down again and finally insisted on putting mains in. I found it offensive that I had to flag her down multiple times in the evening to keep the meal paced properly.
Meanwhile, the busboy came by and cleared everything off the table...almost aggressively. Then he completely failed to reset the table. When mains showed up, we got food before the table had silver, which is just amateur at best... if you serve food, you should be watching and on top of the table and what's on it at all times. This was clueless... and then when we did finally get silver, after asking and staring at our food, no steak knives arrived... and yet some of us had meat that needed to be cut. We had to flag the bus boy down, deal with the major language gap, and finally we got knives.
Mains were okay - a little bland and underseasoned; my veal was overcooked significantly, toughening it up. The folks at the table with pasta were hit or miss. Some were ok, some were more al dente than they should've been, leaving the pasta still crunchy in spots, not toothy.
Overall, probably not going back... food would've been adequate for a return visit, but the appalling lack of service creates an atmosphere that I would happily forgo. There's lots of places here along Madison that do a good job attending to their customers; I'd rather spend money there and get a consistent experience with good service...
Sad... I like Italian, but they just don't seem to have their stuff together in a way the looks rank amateurish at best.","Susan G.","We just enjoyed our 3rd meal in about as many weeks at Park Place. The food and service have been consistently good. I really appreciate the breadth of choices on the menu. In spite of that, I think I have favorites already: the chicken Marsala and the Salciccia Arrabiata. Go check it out! You'll be happy to have this friendly restaurant with tasty food in the neighborhood.","Shirley N.","The restaurant has a pleasant, quiet ambience. The good was delicious. The service was excellent.","Erin H.","I came here over Memorial Day weekend, the restaurant is very cute! Has a great selection of wine and the server was very attentive. However, the food was just ok. I had the veal and my friend had the chicken parmesan which was good but not anything amazing. Another disappointment was that they are listed on passports app as accepting passport. However, the waiter informed us they no longer accept passport since December which I thought was odd. Overall it was ok, not great not bad.","Vincent R.","It's okay. It was a little disappointing as far as serving size, i.e. calamari. Mozzarella di bufala was good, but it was served with unripe tomatoes. Pasta (linguine con vongole) was edible, but not worth $21. Chicken saltimbocca was uninspired and not worth $26. The gnocchi was best. Can't recommend this place, head back to Capitol Hill.","Fort D.","Decided to splurge for new year's eve with my bestie. And the best thing about Park Place, for us, was the cozy, traditional Little Italy decor. Warm, yellow light, railroad layout. Judging by the clientele, this is a beloved neighborhood eatery.
Sadly, the food wasn't very good, either in appearance or in taste, especially at 30-40 dollar plates. My bolognese presented as ragu from a jar atop overcooked spaghetti. Was flashing back to my high school cafeteria while eating it. Her catch of the day, swordfish, was heavily salted and its flavors squelched by too many seasonings.
Undaunted, we chose the marscapone amaretto cheesecake for afters. One bite each, and we put up our napkins. There was a chemical taste and poor texture.
To their credit, they comped the desert. The service was great, if you like the whole Sartre-ian waiter-faith thing.
We enjoyed our night, just none of the food. I hope they can tune up their menu a bit.","Jennifer B.","If I could give 3.5 stars I would, but I rounded up because the ambiance was wonderful and the service was good.
This place has a lot of potential and if I lived in the neighborhood I'd probably give it a second chance, but our first visit was missing some execution on the dishes we ordered.
My boyfriend had the bolognese and it was decent but not very saucy and rich like others we've tried.
I had the prawns and I was really looking forward to them because the description included butternut squash and truffle vinaigrette which are some of my favorite things! Unfortunately the prawns were really charred and over cooked, the butternut squash was hard and undercooked and I tasted zero hint of truffle.
The portion sizes were really generous, but for the price point and white tablecloths ambiance I would've expected more consistency!","Mathias C.","Came here for lunch. Delicious food, awesome service and a really great vibe. I especially loved the paninis!","Stephanie K.","Always on point.
Food is top notch and great wine list.
The service on point.
EVERY DISH WAS AMAZING! Really enjoyed my dining experience. Highly recommended!!"
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Lisa S.","I love the ambience of this place, and the food is delicious. They're bread is so good and so are the pizzas.","Karen G.","Caring Owner - all over it! Appreciate the text!
Bad Service!!
3rd Visit ... I'm so bummed I really liked this place but they have a serving problem. I originally gave this place a five star but on my second visit did not receive any service it was as if the serving staff were in a fight and no one was going to wait on this one table which is where we were seated. Definitely one of the most awkward visits to a restaurant ever. We waited so long we eventually had to excuse ourselves and leave with no service no one even tried to stop us to apologize. This was my husband's birthday. Prices these days are so high you can't risk inconsistency. I'll leave my original review below.
Food made with love in West Seattle. We had breakfast. Nice atmosphere! Windows open and fresh bread! Best mushroom frittata","Jane M.","Very good wood fire pizza place with amazing lasagna.. we stopped there one sunday evening and the place wasnt busy at all.. ambience super nice and welcoming.. lots of space..staff is nice.. plenty of street parking around..
Well now the food.. we ordered the lasagna this was really delicious and fresh tomatoes you could tell it from the flavors.. we then ordered the spring lamb and pinochio pizzas and both the pizzas were great i liked the spring lamb a tad more than the pinocchio just cos of the pesto basil it tasted really good.. unfortunately i did not have time to try their desserts but will stop by again to dry their desserts.. good spot in california ave area..","Sheila G.","Food was pretty good, but service is terrible. Both times I've been here the service has been awful.
The first time I went, we ordered 10 minutes before happy hour. Instead of the server telling us HH started in ten minutes, he made sure we ordered prior so we'd have to pay full price.
The second time I went with a larger party. Anytime we'd ask for something (like a photo or a candle in the dessert) the waitress would act annoyed like we were wasting her time.
If service were better I'd give this place a 3.5. They have a few really good pizzas, but they're salads aren't anything special.","Roger B.","I was surprised when Mioposto came to North Admiral as we already had a brick oven pizzeria and a number of other pizzeria venues. Somehow they've fit in and seem to be busy. Of benefit is their location. A nice brick building that is the last restaurant heading North on California. It's well decorated and has a nice ambience inside including a large glimmering painting of horses on the wall. (I think one of the horses is missing a leg.)
I like meat so the Pinocchio is the pizza for me. The crust is crisp yeasty with a light sweetness. When I'm in for cheese, I love the Quattro Formaggi with milled tomatoes. I don't like clams here as much as some of my friends do as I prefer a red sauce with my bivalves. The lasagna is quite good. Baked in the same brick oven as the pizza.
Service has been solid.","Kristin P.","One of my new favorite places! Food is amazing, service is very good, and the ambience is so friendly and quaint. They use real and fresh ingredients...makes you feel like you're in Italy!","Sheri C.","Finally able to dine at Mioposto after a couple failed attempts due to my impatience of not wanting to wait for over 1 hour for a table, I was really pleased!
A friend chose Mioposto to celebrate her birthday. A couple of us got together with her. We shared their antipasti plate of goat cheese, olive tapenade, agro dolce, roasted and marinated eggplant, prosciutto and arugula with bread. The cheese was really good and the prosciutto was perfection. I got the lamb pizza, which comes with onion, goat cheese (had a lot of goat cheese that night), roasted red peppers and mint. I really liked the lamb; I ended up picking off the peppers. The mozzarella was divine. A friend got a pepperoni pie while the other ordered lasagna. The person who ordered the pepperoni commented that the crust was a bit burnt but frankly I think he wasn't use to a wood fired crust; it didn't look burnt to me but I wasn't eating it either.
The server offered a free dessert to the birthday girl, so she got tiramisu and loved it. I ordered their apple crostada and asked for the vanilla ice cream to be on the side because it was freezing cold in there. As soon as I ordered it that way, I realized how illogical that was. Go figure.
Mioposto is decorated in a really pleasing way. It's a small dining area with a couple booths, a few tables and a long communal table in the center. Their bar has sports going but not loudly. The lighting is cool. There's a giant horse mural on one wall that is pretty sweet.
Parking in this neighborhood sucks, but that is West Seattle for you. If you can't find a spot on the street, because there is no lot here, drive up the road to Safeway and park there then walk a couple blocks.
Our waiter/server was also that night's bartender. He kept good tabs on us even though he was wearing multiple hats.
Food: 4
Service: 5
Ambiance: 5
Parking: 2","Joline R.","My husband and I first came here almost a year ago and we both really enjoyed our pizzas. I ordered the clam pizza and he ordered the pepperoni with honey and their chilli oil, he talks highly about this combination haha. Anyway, we recently celebrated his birthday here because he wanted to keep it simple and get his pizza. The staff was awesome when I coordinated the reservation as it was a surprise brunch. Customer service is like the cherry on top for me and I'd recommend it for that alone.","Katie D.","I love Mioposto, I do. But this location is not good. Something is always off when I come to this one, & this past Saturday was no exception. While the pizza was fine, the greens in my beet salad were so slimy. The salad had definitely been made far ahead of my ordering it. The music they were playing incredibly dorky & soft, almost Christian sounding pop. (According to Shazam, one of the bands was called The Script?) Unfortunately, it got on my nerves so badly, I had a panic attack. My brain chemistry is NOT their fault, but throughout the meal, we were both so completely turned off by the music. Why not just play some whatever downtempo instead of something some customers would find obnoxious? In all of the years I've been eating there (primarily at the one in Mount Baker), I've never heard anything like it. Imagine the soundtrack from a Hallmark movie. Luckily, my attack happened after we had signed our bills, & that was that.","Audrey C.","This is our favorite pizza spot in West Seattle. I love the antipasti platter and sometimes I actually just order that for dinner. My other half is a huge fan of their pizza apple pie dessert which they make in the pizza oven.
My favorite pizzas are the Spring Lamb and Zucca Balsamica, but I've enjoyed every pizza we have tried there; except the Egg and Pancetta pizza was a bit too spicy for my tastes.
Great spot!","Karen B.","This was our first time at the restaurant. The wine list is excellent with many Italian and Washington wines. We had a fantastic Italian red for a reasonable price. Our server was wonderful and gave everyone a little taste of the wine. It was very fair and democratic. I liked her style. Excellent salads especially the beet and goat cheese salad. Pizza was also great. We'll be back.","Monica D.","I am a fan, it is a warm and friendly place with great atmosphere and service.
It can get a little too crowded and harried but it is a busy place.
Pizza's and salads are solid. The beet salad is delish!
The only dish I will not order again is the calamari, soaked in sauce, heavy tomato, chewy small and disappointing. I will go back for pizza, salads and vino anytime.","Wennie H.","Man, I love Mioposto for dinner but brunch was incredible. Honestly can't believe how blown away we were by the food. We love their pizza and the brunch options were just perfect. Morning service was a little hectic (one server) but she was super friendly and helpful.
We got the Stromboli (basically a margherita pizza with eggs, caramelized onions and potato folded in half). It was delicious, I think it could have used a bit more sauce but it wasn't dry by any means. It wasn't overwhelming salty or anything, a bit on the blander side but still good. My favorite was the pananata (chopped up French toast topped with apple cinnamon and powdered sugar). It was SO GOOD. I know at some point I'll have to use other words but words are escaping me. It wasn't too sweet, but sweet enough that I didn't need syrup. I literally ate the whole plate because despite my gf saying it was good, she isn't a huge fan of sweets....and I tried to tell myself to not eat it all but my self control isn't too strong.
We opted for no pancetta and they didn't have any subs but it was fine. Also ordered a coffee and a side of hashbrowns (gf said hashbrowns were really good).
Price point was good. Not expensive at all and super affordable. Our new favorite brunch spot and right down the street!","Christina H.","After going to Mioposto in Mt. Baker, we gave the Alki location a try (it was closer to where we were staying anyways). It was also a good option, although the Mt. Baker location is in a way better setting. This one was at least not in the busy downtown Alki area, so parking was easier than we expected (but still took a bit of searching).
We ordered similar items as what we had at the Mt. Baker location (I got the beet salad, margarita pizza but I added mushrooms this time, and WA red blend; my husband got the caesar, pepperoni pizza with prosciutto on the side, but tried a medium colored nitro beer). The food was relatively consistent; something about the beet salad at the Mt. Baker location was better (I think the almonds were more finely ground and there were more beets). We also had to get normal size pizzas since we missed the timeframe for the salad/pizza special, and those were nice. I forgot to order extra crispy, so I highly recommend doing that (makes it well done all the way through - definitely way better!). The basil on my pizza was not shredded like at the other location, totally minor, but I wasn't as big of a fan of that. Also, the mushroom topping is called a ""mushroom trio,"" and it was actually just one kind of mushroom (crimini). Again nothing super big, but just a little confusing as ""trio"" means ""three."" My husband loved the nitro beer and said it was super smooth (I apologize for not remembering the exact name, but it was a medium brown and not hoppy at all).
The service wasn't as great as Mt. Baker. It might have been the time we were there (late 3's/early 4's). Our waitress was busy doing other things (appeared to be prepping for the dinner crowds), so there were long periods of waiting. We didn't mind since we were just relaxing. Eventually another waiter took over. Not the same attentiveness as the other location, but still not bad.
At the end of the day, the food was still great. If I had the opportunity to choose between the different locations, I think it's obvious what my pick is (Mt. Baker), but again, this location isn't bad.","Gina C.","We've been locals for a long time and only recently started going here. We're not big pizza and pasta people so we tend to avoid Italian places but we now love this place. We go for the meatballs and salads. (And the pizza is yummy).
But if you're a couple out in a date, here's the secret- go chill at their back bar. We love just sitting at their bar sipping a cocktail and having a bite to eat, a slight distance away from the family friendly dining room.","Allison P.","This is a very great pizza place in west Seattle! Ended up here the first time after helping a friend move and we were all starving! And they did not disappoint we all left super happy and full!
The place is good size but gets packed! There was a small wait on a Friday nights but thankfully we were able to get some wine at the bar while we waited!
Our server who I wish I could remember her name was AMAZING! We were a loud all over the place group and she fit in perfectly! She recommended the potato pizza and oh my gosh it was delicious!! She really knows what she is talking about. Also recommended a great red wine for the table! Service and food came out relatively fast for how crowded it was.
I will totally be back just for that potato pizza!!","Grace G.","Delicious food, but horrible service. When we sat down at our table, we sat there for 10 minutes waiting be helped. My mom tried waving down two different waiters and neither helped us. It was completely rude to say the least. Disappointing.","Bob B.","Great neighborhood restaurant. Staff is always friendly and food is generally good.
We are big fans of the la Bianca and the antipasti. Be sure to order your pizza extra crispy.
Great atmosphere and good food.","Davis B.","Best vegan pizza in the city!
This place is the perfect date night spot. Great, atmosphere, friendly service, great drinks and DELICIOUS pizza. Easy to make the pizzas vegan and the baked bread appetizer is seriously one of the best appetizers around - hands down. YUM!
The place can get pretty busy sometimes so make sure to plan accordingly.","Alia Mariah P.","Great brunch spot! The mimosas are delicious, made with fresh orange juice! The food is always fast and tasty. I love the bartender Sarah. She is always very attentive and happy! Highly recommended!"
"Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria - South Lake Union","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tutta-bella-neapolitan-pizzeria-south-lake-union-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Hee Jo C.","Wow....impressed. Bolognese pasta was amazing....and Pietro pizza was amazing!! Thin crust with just enough topping to fill your mouth bursting with flavors!! If you havent tried...you MUST.
All ingredients made from scratch and importes from Italy.","Caroline T.","If you work in South Lake Union, you know lunch time (11:30am-2pm) can be a bit of a mad house when it comes to finding food without crazy lines.
Having recently moved to Seattle, I've had some difficulty finding a local pizzeria that offers quality without having to spend an outrageous amount (seriously, $30 cheese or pepperoni pies?). Tutta Bella is one of the first local options I've found that serves up a tasty pizza AND with a reasonable price.
From the host to our server, the staff was friendly and helpful with suggesting some of their favorites. We were given the option of where to sit (sort of unheard of with a lunch rush), and opted for the counter so we could watch the pizza making. It's pretty fun to see the pizza you just ordered get made in front of you, and to see it cook.
They do offer lunch specials (mini pizza for a few bucks off), but if you're hungry enough I'd just go with the regular or larger option.
The space was relatively packed, but service was prompt with no considerable lags between ordering to getting our food to paying. Perfect if you're popping in for a quick lunch break.
I'll definitely come back again and try some of their other options.
Tips:
-Limited parking
-If you're coming from Westlake Ave, there's a large staircase on the right of Whole Foods that leads up to Tutta Bella (which is at the top to the left)
-Tutta Bella does have a loyalty program, be sure to grab one of the cards with the information to download the app/redeem (if your server hasn't included it with the bill)","Mihir S.","A place like this shouldn't exist. This is the second time I decided to give this place a try.
The first time we dined in. Ordered 1 appetizer and 2 pizzas. The appetizer which had meatballs was impressive. Then the pizzas arrive. The dough was so chewy despite the bread being good quality. The execution was terrible and as a result we had an upset stomach the next day. It's possible they used the dough past it's expiration date because it didn't settle well in my stomach.
The second time we ordered pickup. I decided to give this pace another try. It was a mistake.
The second time the pizza was completely soggy. The pasta carbonara was unseasoned and dry. It tasted miserable.
A place like this in South Lake Union does not deserve to exist. And I am confident the reviews here are all astroturfed.
Please avoid this place at all costs. Yes, they have happy hour. But so does a dozen other joints at South Lake Union. I recommend against dining here.","Mia Z.","Manager reached out to me after my last review and invited us back for another try. It was definitely very nice of her and it showed they cares about customer service.
We finally got around to it today and the experience is definitely much better.
Well our server was attentive and they were not short of staff today.
Food was made and customized just as requested. Delicious and no error. I would highly recommend their seasonal menu. We got the peach dessert today and it was absolutely out of the world good.
Be noted that they have a shared parking lot with other businesses in the same plaza as Whole Foods and they validate parking so it's easy and peasy.
They have the best gelato too! We got chocolate flavor today!","Jenna C.","Came here for lunch with a coworker and received great service. Food came out quickly so we were able to enjoy our meal and get back to work within an hour. I got the prosciutto and mushroom pizza, which has red sauce. The crust was perfectly cooked and not too chewy or burnt.","Melody L.","Tough to find pizza spot above the Whole Foods. Tuesday night vibes were pleasant, and the place was not too busy or loud. Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly. He was very helpful when it came to answering our questions while ordering. I split a 13 inch pizza with one other person and was satisfied enough.
The food came out in a very reasonable amount of time and tasted quite good. However, the pizza had some really burnt spots that you'd definitely want to avoid eating. I also felt like the pizza was mostly crust, which has to be my least favorite part of pizza. Some of the menu items are a bit overpriced, especially the garlic knots. Also, the knots could definitely use some marinara sauce for dipping.","Peter N.","Came here for happy hour. It was a little slow, not too many people. The waitresses were nice. I ordered the happy hour cheese pizza, burrata, and the carbonara. The pizza and caprese were good. Those 2 items came out quickly. Their house bread was really unique and tasty. The carbonara came out last and we sat around for 15 or 20 minutes after we finished the pizza and burrata. Unfortunately, it was super bland. I tried to make sure I tossed it with the sauce and added extra cheese to give it a chance, but it just didn't taste good. It tasted like unsalted butter pasta. I ate a few bites and sent it back because I didn't want to just eat empty carbs. After that moment the wait staff wasn't as friendly as they were before. They offered me a comped dessert which was a kind gesture. I won't be coming back and recommend avoiding the carbonara.","Vivian L.","After living in Napoli, Italy for 6 months and developing a taste bud for authentic Italian cuisine and Neapolitan pizzas, I don't usually bother with pizzas back home as they usually are not worth the task. I've been hankering for Neapolitan pizzas for quite some time now and we had just spent all day unpacking into our new home. We decided to treat ourselves for pizza and the only one I'd want is a Neapolitan one that I didn''t have to drive to and there is was, Tutta Bella... 2 minutes walk from our new apartment (Kiara).
Is it good? Why, Yes, why yes it is. At least mine was. It was so good I didn't bother tasting my husband's pizza. But let me start with the starter.
Salad (Ceasar salad with anchovies) - the bite, bursting with flavors. From the lemon zest to the fresh cracked peppercorns to the crunch in romaine lettuces to the sinking of the teeth into the cheese slices to the burnt notes of the crouton toasts... all, perfecto! The anchovies bring it allllll in.
Pizza (The Roberto) - extra virgin olive oil, pistachio purée, Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, smoked buffalo mozzarella, basil, egg (per request), finished with pecorino Romano. Did I mention, PISTACHIO PURÉE? Have you tried, pistachio purée? On a pizza? I highly doubt it. Pizzas come with all sort of crazy toppings theses days, pistachio should definitely be one of them! Bc is not a big meat/chicken eater, I get egg on everything. I don't think it would've been as good without the egg. Perfectly cooked and runny. It was goood you should've seen our plates : empty.
Dessert (Gelato)- first timers get a freebie! Hubby and I both got ours complimented. What a nice treat! His was salted caramel, mine the seasonal orange. His was a little salty and mine was refreshing but a little too sweet. We both aren't avid sugar eaters but we both finished our desserts.
Atmosphere : smacking view of the iconic Seattle Space Needle. Romantic views of city lights. Pretty much the cleanest polished looking pizzeria I'd ever been to, surpassing ones in LA and California Pizza Kitchens, yet, chillaxed. Rooftop patios = DOG FRIENDLY :).
Upstairs from Whole Foods.
Opens late.
Service : wonderful. Helpful, attentive, and not overbearing.
Sustainability : Reusables dining in. Cardboard boxes takeout/delivery. Recycles & composts.
Happy hour : Daily (3-6 / 9-close)

I've gone to all three locations and they all taste the same and by that I mean AMAZING!! I usually get the margarita pizza and Caesar salad and hubby gets something different every time and he's never been unhappy! We freaking love this place! We used to go at least once a week (no joke) but we moved states so when we visit we go at least once or twice. We've also had Fantastic service almost every time we've been. Definitely recommend this place to all pizza lovers!","Tanusree M.","Came here for lunch with a few coworkers. They each got a pizza and I got a salad. I got the napoli salad, it was pretty large! It was definitely one of the better salads I have ever had. The chicken was so nice and crispy. I am used to chicken in salad being just boiled or grilled, not very flavorful. But the chicken in this salad had a nice crust on it. The contents in the salad were also very satisfying. The cheese and ham were my favorite. I also got a lemoncoco on the side, this was alright. I am not sure what I was expecting, but it was an interesting flavor. It tasted like a thicker coconut water to me, I was not a fan.
Anyway, the salad was delicious. Definitely try the napoli if you are here.","Poornima B.","I have walked by this so many times but have never thought of stepping in.
I am not a pizza fan but a few days ago without any options nearby without a huge wait-list my team and I decided to stop by for lunch.
I picked the clam spaghetti while most of them picked pizzas and one chose the lasagna.
Everything was medicore. Nothing much to have about. The server was pleasant and sweet but took a while to bring stuff around.
We also got two desserts , a tiramisu and a Nutella calzone.
The calzone was like a giant croissant and tasted ok because it was warm. It would not taste great otherwise. The tiramisu was humongous . Despite there people sharing the bowl there was a lot left.
The above mentioned along with some beverages came up to $100 ish.
I am not a fan and I don't see myself going back here.","Shaylor S.","This place was really good and authentic. Some of the best pizza I've had. The Bianca pizza is super good! Especially if you like goat cheese. Our server was very nice. We went around 5 o'clock and we were basically the only ones there. Service was really quick and our pizza came out hot and cooked to perfection. There was some confusion on if the pizza was half off for happy out and it turns out it wasn't. Spent quite a bit on it. Overall though really good pizza! The crust is thin in the middle but thick on the outside. Make sure you ask for the free gelato if it is your first time there! I got the Nutella flavor and even though I'm in love with Nutella, it wasn't my favorite flavor. I'd try a different flavor.","Stephen F.","Ended up here twice in the same week. Great happy hour, small plate combinations. The soup is wonderful and a perfect way to begin your meal. The pizzas are perfectly sized for one, and taste better than they smell.","Kavya T.","Greattt Italian style pizza, burrata and eveything else. They even have gelato! They have outdoor seating, which makes it even better :)","Tony J.","Italian restaurant in the heart of South Lake Union. It is located right above the Whole Foods. Mid-size restaurant. Went on a non-Friday weeknight and they were doing decent business, but we didn't have to wait for a table.
As their name indicates, their specialty is the Neapolitan Pizza. They also have salads, pastas, and gelato for dessert. I got the personal size (10 inch) prosciutto and arugula pizza. They put plenty of arugula on the pizza. The pizza tasted quite good, as the saltiness of the prosciutto blends well with the cheesy aroma of the pizza and the fresh arugula. A 10 inch pizza was the perfect portion for me. If you go during happy hour (4-6, and 9 to close), you get a small discount on the pizzas and cocktails.","Victoria H.","The pizza and service here was not the best I have ever had, but wasnt the worst either. I went for lunch one day.
I had the meatball pizza with Ricotta cheese. It tastes great, but was messy and wound up not settling well with me either. The service was ok. The individual that was our server took a very long time to get our drinks and to get the check correct. It was somewhat embarrassing.
The vibe was very casual and very hip. I really liked the vibe. Please be aware it is noisy in here so if you want to have a more private conversation, avoid going here as you will have to speak up or seem like your yelling at times.
Overall, it fed me, and that is all that I have to say. Definitely not the best pizza in town but not the worst either.","Lauren P.","Loved every bite. Neapolitan pizza at its finest smack dab in the middle of SLU. Was not disappointed.","James R.","Going to Tutta Bella's in Westlake was an experience that was different compared to Columbia City. Overall the place was spacious with an attentive wait staff and a relaxed atmosphere. I had the Roberto pizza and it was very nice, the buffalo cheese adds a little smokey flavor which was very refreshing on the palate. Of course I splurged and got the Tutta Bella Amber Ale (handcrafted by them). The gelato which I got the orange flavor, adds a nice citrus flavor, and tastes just like creamsicle! The espresso being strong adds a nice bitter taste which limits the sweetness of the gelato. Lastly with the view of the Space Needle right outside the window, this place is truly remarkable in presentation and overall aesthetics; both food and atmosphere wise. I will most definitely be returning here again in the near future.","Jared M.","A great spot for Italian pizzas and pastas, Tutta Bella keeps some things traditional and changes some things up with some fun experimental dishes. The cheese in the buffala starter was nice and creamy and spread easily on the fresh crostini. The pizza with the pistachio was fantastic, like a cross between peanut butter and pesto with actual cashews on the pizza. Fun play on the pizza. I tried some of the traditional pizzas and they were also very fresh with quality cheese.
Overall really liked this place and will be back before long.","Lptake R.","We ordered the Roberto pizza and their meatloaf lasagna. I was not a big fan of both these dishes and the taste was mediocre. The quantity was way too less for the price. The only thing that I liked was the ambience and the service."
"Via Rosa 11","https://www.yelp.com/biz/via-rosa-11-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Allison C.","It is always exciting visiting Seattle but it is quite a treat to take a giant ferry over to Bainbridge Island and to stumble upon a truly authentic Italian restaurant in the states. Like Santa Claus, they do exist, my friends!
Instantly, Via Rosa 11 sets the mood of feeling as if you are walking into a restaurant in Venice that is amongst the cobblestone streets, through the arched passageways, away from the shops, just tucked away with a quaint outside seating area covered in beautiful vine covered lattices with opened doors welcoming you home. But a home unlike any other, this is a home with a framed photo of Sophia Lauren, homemade pastas lining the counter, and a beautiful decadent white and blue tiled wood burning oven. Every detail is absolutely perfect.
I ordered the bolognese which came to me still steaming, the meat was tender, every bite packed with flavor, and a side of toasted bread. Honestly, I can't say enough wonderful compliments. I will be back to Bainbridge just to satisfy my dreams of eating here again. Spettacolare!","Marjorie H.","Best Italian I have EVER had. Very authentic. Simple traditional menu. Fresh ingredients. Flavorful! The staff were AMAZING and friendly!! Quaint and cozy. This is a MUST place to go eat when visiting Seattle.","Scott B.","Best pizza on the island. We got the speck and buratta and a side of the spaghetti with pesto on the advice of the owner's daughter. UhMazing! The pIzza was neopolitan style with an impossibly thin crust. Pesto was the best I ever had. The personnel were friendly and extremely accommodating. They understand great food and customer service. We will be back!","Diana F.","My go to for Italian food. Always fresh, friendly service and did I mention the food! OMG delizioso! The squid ink pasta brings back memories when my Mother use to make hers in the kitchen. Best place in Kitsap","Brenda H.","Loved this find - great rec, Yelp! It's out of the way, down a side road after another road, and next to a Jiffy Mart. But it's the most authentic Italian I've seen in a while. Freshly made pasta? Pizza? Sauce and everything? Great flavors, and the counter service is welcome. Most Italian restaurants are sit-down and fancy, while this felt like a deli.
I've lived in Italy before on a military base, and this feels just like the pizza counter in the Agnano Commisary, just so much brighter!","Sherry C.","OMG I want to work here! The girls helping us were just so cute and super sweet! They made suggestions for pizza and pasta and we were not disappointed!
Place is super clean and nicely decorated. They have cool outdoor seating and one of the girls even came outside and chatted with us for a bit. She told us about the island and some places to check out. I am definitely stopping in again if I am ever in the area.","Becky N.","This was a lovely find just a short ways from our vrbo. Homemade pasta and sauces were very good but didn't stand out to me. I think my husband was a little more enamored than I was and would've rated a four. I found the seating somewhat disconcerting as there isn't a lot of it and it feels a bit like you are stalking people (and being stalked yourself). The working owner/chef was obviously beloved and came out often for hugs and to chat with people. I could definitely envision living here, getting off the ferry on my way home from work and stopping for a quick carry out of pasta and a bottle of wine.","Richard F.","Went here for both lunch and then picked up dinner for later as well. Great Italian market with fresh food, sides, and pastas and helpful staff. Definitely at least 4.5 stars.
For lunch we got a panino and raditore pasta with pesto. And then came back for a pound of fusilli with some bolognese sauce and a caprese salad. Very good!","Marie B.","Literally saving the best post for last from my recent spontaneous 3 day birthday weekend. This Yelp post was for a first time visit to Via Rosa 11 on 6/9/18.
I knew absolutely nothing about this Rolling Bay restaurant, except that local resident and avid Yelper George S. mentioned takeout lasagne. I'm probably am the biggest Italian cuisine fan, but never travelled there. Yet.
After stops at nearby Bay Hay and Feed and the newbie wine tasting at Rolling Bay Winery, it was time to have some lunch. What a phenomenal culinary find ! Via Rosa 11 functions both as an Italian retail market and restaurant.
The counter staff are friendly and patient with newcomers who have to ponder the vast choices. I kid you not, it was tough. Plus the servings are generous, a challenge since I was dining solo.
There are daily specials, salads, soups, antipasti, panini, pizza, pasta including ravioli, lasagne, gnocchi, crostini, desserts, ad naseum.
I can't imagine someone not finding something fantastic to enjoy.
For Seattleites, it's like a mashup of Il Corvo, Pasta and Co., Delaurenti's, and PFI, but scaled down. It also exudes a tight community vibe, a lovely open food prep/ kitchen area, plus a wood fired oven.
I ended up ordering the Burrata salad ($12) with arugula, burrata, cherry or grape tomatoes, olives, pickled onion, baby peppers, radish all nicely dressed in balsamic, plus opted for two (not four) crostini. Next time there is polpo/octopus salad....
Plus who could resist fresh pasta cooked to order with your choice of sauce ($13)? This handmade pasta aficionado selected paparadelle with bolognese. Lovely presentation...tasted wonderful on 6/9 and even when microwaved at work today on 6/13. That's quality goodness!
Lots of beverage choices too, but the iced lemon water was a nice touch.
While I was texting back and forth with George S. via Yelp, I paused and asked the gentleman weaving between tables whether he was Pino, the restaurant owner.
Indeed he was and he regaled me with vivid stories of growing up eating fresh, seasonal, coastal food from Imperia in the Liguria region. He even showed me pictures and postcards off the kitchen wall. Family anecdotes and inspirations are the best!
He said he never goes to ""work""...truly this is a genuine individual who loves what he does and wants to share that with you. He is living the dream!
When he realized that I visited here on a whim for my birthday, he kindly gave me free cannoli. Mmmmm, so tasty. I'll have to be prepared next time have a cooler and order the pan of tiramisu.
As I'm busing my table (the entire place was filling up with customers amid the kitchen bustling kitchen activity), I was called over to see one of the culinary staff pull out large porchettas from the oven. I can only imagine that sliced thin in a panini sandwich or an open faced ciabatta.
Yes, I ventured in and dined alone at Via Rosa 11. But the welcoming atmosphere and delicious cuisine made me feel like a Bainbridge Island regular on a whirlwind field trip to Liguria.
Grazie mille, Chef Pino and of course, George S.","Ninette C.","This is a charming, unsuspecting, casual Italian restaurant tucked away from on Bainbridge Island, even away from downtown Bainbridge Island.
The 5 of us ordered:
-Pizza of the day with prosciutto and burrata: voted as the best dish of the meal by the fiance. The crust is very well done and made in the wood fired oven.
-Mushroom pappardelle: my favorite dish of the meal. They put so much mushroom in there and the pappardelle is so fresh.
-Buratta salad: my dad's favorite. You get a very generous serving of buratta with the house salad.
-Side of cauliflower: a good side. Not a standout but good to get some vegetables in.
-Seafood on squid ink linguine: this was the first dish I chose but we all agreed they dropped the ball a bit. The linguine was way too soft and the dish overall was a bit salty.
All in all, we really enjoyed our meal here. We'd definitely come back but will skip the seafood linguine next time.","Robert V.","What do you do on Friday night when you've failed to plan your evening? Go to Via Rosa and have a amazing meal. I had capellini aglio olio with Calabrian peppers. Beyond being so fresh, it had the zing I was looking for. I'm always amazed at the way even a simple dish like this is raised to the highest level. And honestly, I'm even more amazed that the place has gotten better over time, with generous portions and always a welcoming atmosphere. Oh, and whatever you do - don't leave without a cannoli for the road. Awesome experience!","Edgar A.","From someone who was in Italy last year, this place is as authentic as you can get. We had the caprese salad, lasagna, pizza, Bellinis. Everything was fantastic.
It's kind of outdoorsy with tables and benches outside for you to sit. The best time to eat is lunch or late lunch, because in the evening, the flies start coming around. However, they do have space inside, but limited, so get there early. Service was great; the ladies that work there help you if it's your first time, and they are accommodating to your needs. Recommend giving this place a try for those who love authentic Italian food; and enjoy eating in the outdoors.","Mary D.","My mom and stepdad live in southern Italy (Capitello, Salerno) for eight months out of the year. I've been to Italy plenty of times. They have a traditional, outdoor stone pizza oven at their Italy home. My stepdad has been making pizza since he was a teenager, usually from scratch, where 'scratch' means 'the sauce is made from tomatoes and herbs he grew himself.'
We are tough customers when it comes to fresh-made pasta and brick-oven pizza.
So much so, in fact, that when they're in the US they usually avoid Italian food -- not just because it's usually too Americanized for their tastes, but because they will freely tell you they're kind of sick of it at that point, and sorta want a cheeseburger and a salad with ranch dressing.
My mother has actually suggested of her own accord when visiting me that we go to Via Rosa 11, which should tell you all you need to know.
The pizzas are thin-crust and a great size for one very hungry person, with potential for leftovers if you're not ravenous. *They also offer burrata.* I've never asked them if it's actual bufala, but it's so tender that it hasn't mattered to me enough to ask. On nights when I feel like splurging on comfort food, I pick up some fresh-made noodles and a container of one of their sauces -- bolognese is a personal favorite, and theirs never lets me down (get the wild boar bolognese if you're feeling especially fancy). I've bought a container of their meatballs in sauce and just eaten those for a meal with a salad. I enjoyed the meatball sub I had, but I can't speak as to the rest of the sandwiches, because when I'm there I'm not usually wanting sandwiches!
The only 'downsides':
1 - Limited seating. If they're slammed, that might present a challenge.
2 - The location means that I didn't learn about this spot until long after I wish I had known it existed, in spite of frequenting the feed store...and I imagine there are other people out there who haven't discovered it yet, either.
It's worth a trip. If you can swing it to hit Bay Hay & Feed and Via Rosa 11 on the same day, I personally think that those two locations alone are worth a trip all the way from Seattle and beyond.","Joe S.","Tied for my favorite Italian place. The food is phenomenal, and in my opinion the most authentic Italian food you could find, short of flying to Italy.","Sue M.","Hidden away off the main drag of Bainbridge is this gem of an Italian restaurant. Fresh handmade pasta, wood fired pizza, savory soups, roasted veggies...so delicious. I would return just for their bolognese sauce, so so good. Thank goodness they had Uber there as this place was a bit far from the marina and all the shops. This place serves nice sized portions along with good quality and this results in a winning combo and a 5 star Yelp review!! Inside seating is limited but if it's nice out like it was today, there's more seating outside.","Rs R.","Delicious! Every food we ordered was amazing! We had pizza, mushroom fettuccine, marechiaro tagliatelle (special), spinach ravioli, and lasagna for 7 people.
Amazing service and incredibly friendly employees.
I would highly recommend this award-winning restaurant!","Shauna R.","Cute atmosphere. Delicious food. Friendly staff. Highly recommend! We made a day trip out of it after seeing it recommended by a local food reviewer.","Thomas M.","Best Italian food outside of Italy. This is one of favorite places on the island and you can make a wonderful afternoon by tasting amazing wine at Rolling Bay Winery and then walk over for a wonderful meal or vice versa. Simply cannot say enough good things about Via Rosa. You absolutely have to have their gnocchi.","Steven B.","A hidden gem and one of Bainbridge's best restaurants. Everything is made in-house and cooked to order. Pastas are perfectly al dente, the wood-fired pizza is crispy and tasty (go for the Zena!) and the soups are fantastic, especially the zucchini.
I love these guys and everything they do!","Jonie L.","Via Rosa is about a ten minute drive from downtown, so only makes sense to go if you have a car (versus walking onto the ferry if visiting from Seattle), and also means you won't just stumble upon it while exploring town.
This place is so fun! They make fresh pastas (which you can buy by the pound too), and you can mix/match what pastas you want with what sauces. There's a good variety too, and they offer suggestions on what pastas go with which sauces if you need some guidance. Though lunch price is $13 for a casual meal, portion size make sense, and enough food even if it doesn't look like it - comes with two pieces of yummy bread too. Both pastas I tried were delicious! Pastas were perfectly cooked, and sauces - both pesto and bolognese, were great. I also appreciated that they both came out super hot!
Also, service was really friendly - we felt really welcomed!
Overall, Via Rosa is a gem on the island, and I'd go back next time I'm in town - can't pass up on a good plate of fresh made pasta!"
"Maggiano’s Little Italy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/maggianos-little-italy-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","Irina P.","Great place for special occasions! Not too pricey. My husband has a birthday and we decided to visit that great place for dinner.
We got Bruschetta Tour for appetizer (must have to try!), lobster carbonara as a main course and broccoli pasta. It was great! Large portions. Very delicious and creamy pastas. Exquisite starter.
Our server was Terence. A great guy! He was very polite, attentive and kind. Also at the end of our experience Terence brought to us birthday cookies with a candle. That was so nice! Thank you for great evening! Will definitely come back again!","Monica E.","Let me start by saying that I've never had a bad experience at Maggianos and I love their food, Rigatoni D and the stuffed mushrooms are my favorite so my girlfriends and I decided to try their brunch. We usually go elsewhere but the menu looked great and who can beat $2 Mimosas??
So we had great service by our waiter and were excited for our meals. The mimosas were yummy and my friends ordered the salmon Benedict and the veggie frittata and I couldn't decide on the Benedict or the Hash but finally settled on the Hash since it promised crispy potatoes, roasted peppers, caramelized onions, & roasted garlic. And the photo online looked delish!
But when we got our meals, my friends' dishes were gorgeous, and looked so appetizing and I get my plate and my expectations were dashed when a dish is put in front of me that looked nothing like the photo or what I would expect from Maggianos.
While the Benedict and frittata were picture-worthy, my hash looked like I was being served someone's leftovers. You couldn't make out where the potatoes, peppers, or onions were because it was just a plate full of brown mush with beef. We could see a few pieces of something red here and there and the bread they served was dry except for the bottom that had gotten soggy sitting on top of the brown mush. In the photo, it shows yummy buttered focaccia. It was like they stopped trying when it came to my dish.
I had to pull up the photo that I had seen online to show my friends that expectation did not live up to reality.
I ate most of it and did not complain because I did not want to embarrass my friends but would never order that again, nor did I think it was worth the price since my dish was more expensive than their
gorgeous dishes.
I don't know who thought to send that dish out looking the way it did but I doubt that Maggianos standards are that low. Hoping it was a fluke. But yeah, won't be ordering the dog food looking mush again:(
Photos for comparison: Expectation photos from their online menu vs. photo I took of reality.
Expectation vs. Reality
Gave them 3 stars cause the waiter was friendly & my friends' dishes were great!","Dhanashree A.","Just walking into this place you get the old italian place vibe, its decorated with black and white photos, huge antique mirrors, feels a little dingy. Its a very typical italian-american restaurant. The place is huge! There are I think 3 sections, each section can be its own restaurant. I got reservations for this place for a team lunch. We were a group of 9 people. They had plenty of open space and we were seated immediately.
We tried a bunch of things here. Their Lasagna, riggatoni arrabiata, Braised Beef Contadina, chicken parm. I got their Jumbo Lump crab cakes. I am not a big fan saucy, cheesy pastas, so I stayed away from them. The Jumbo Lump Crab cakes are quite opposite to their name, 22$ for two tiny crab cakes, some arugula, and an aioli. Seems quite steep. On the other hand the beef contadina is 27$ for a portion enough for 3 meals?! I know crab cakes are usually pricier, but this is the smallest portion I have seen for the price. The overall verdict was good. Everyone said they liked their pastas. The service was good. We didn't have to ask twice for anything, and we got our food also on time, considering it was a large order.
All in all not a very memorable meal. Given that I don't enjoy the style of food I don't see myself returning, unless its another team lunch and someone chooses this place. There are plenty of better, more authentic italian places in Bellevue. I would prefer going there instead.","Ibrahim A.","If you are looking for a decent family style American- Italian place, then this is the place to go. This place has a really good service and staff are very accommodating. The quality of the food is decent and their servings are quite big. I went to this place with a large group and we shared a couple of dishes. They also have a kids menu for 7.99 and kids also get free desert with their order . When you order from their main pasta menu they also give you one free pasta dish to take home with you.
Starters
We ordered the Caesar salad and the house salad. They both were good and would recommend trying them out.
Entrees
The dish that really standard out was the Arabiata rigatoni. It had a rich creamy red sauce and lots of good flavor. Another dish I would highly recommend trying out is the shrimp fra Diavola.
Desert
We ended up ordering the desert sampler where you try out 5 types of desserts. I would say my favorite was the tiramisu.
Finally, I would highly recommend giving this place a try, I would say it is one of the best family style American- Italian restaurants with reasonable prices.","Jennifer J.","I went to Maggiano's for dinner last night with some friends as an early holiday celebration. It was one of the few restaurants in the area with reservations available for our party of 8 during this busy season, and I was looking forward to terrific Italian food all day. Sadly, I left disappointed.
But first, the good things: this is a large restaurant, but they pull of a smaller restaurant feel with traditional red 'n white checked tablecloths and fast/friendly service. Our waitress was attentive and came to take our drink orders right away, followed by explaining their extensive menu and telling us about their holiday special (if you order from their Classics menu you get a whole separate entree to take home for free - what a deal)! These Classics included fettucini alfredo, spaghetti and meatballs, baked ziti, and lasagna to name a few.
I started by ordering a glass of house merlot. It's 100% my bad that I didn't ask the price of the merlot. I assumed (wrongly) that a glass of house red wine at an Italian chain restaurant would be reasonably priced ($10 or less). Imagine my surprise when the bill came and the glass was $15! It was basically the same price as my entree. It's been awhile since I paid $15 for a glass of house wine. In hindsight, I should have asked. But...ouch.
We started with some calamari, which was pretty good - although it was served with marinara sauce and I felt the two did not pair well. Perhaps a cocktail sauce would have been more fitting. I only had a few calamari, in anticipation of my meal. Soon enough my lasagna arrived. It was a huge portion, and I eagerly dove in with my fork. The first thing I tasted was salt. Now, I love salt. But this was WAYYYY over-salted. I asked my friend, who had also ordered the lasagna, and he said his was salty too. I didn't want to make a fuss, so I ate about 1/3 of it before I couldn't stomach anymore of that salt. I did mention it to the waitress, just as an FYI to pass along to the kitchen (did not expect ANYTHING in return) and she basically could have cared less. Oh well.
The best bite of the meal was the creme brulee, which was HUGE and fun to share with the rest of the table. All in all, though, the entire experience was meh and - for the $70 I shelled out including food, wine, and gratuity I left feeling pretty frustrated. Oh well, at least I got a free ravioli to take home for lunch today. Hoping it's less salty!","Erica S.","First time here with my boyfriend and we were sooo glad that we came. Everything we had was amazing!!! I rarely will enjoy everything ordered at a new restaurant, but this place blew my mind. The garlic bread was to die for. The chicken was the best chicken I've ever had; It was so juicy and flavorful. My boyfriend enjoyed his steak and ravioli so much. Best tasting ravioli we've had so far. To top it off was the great service we had from our server, Vinay. He recommended the garlic bread to us and we're so happy that he did, we couldn't ask for anyone better. We will definitely be coming back here and bringing family/friends.","Kish M.","I am always on the lookout for a great, neighborhood Italian Restaurant and Maggiano's Little Italy comes very, very close to my ideal comfort eatery.
Let me be clear, Maggiano's is in the heart of downtown Bellevue, you have to park in a parking garage and walk to the restaurant but once inside, it has the right feel and the food was the real deal, yep, I will be eating here often.
First thing was the service, if you have read any of my past reviews you will see I don't judge restaurants on the service, for me it is all about the food and the atmosphere or ambiance if you will but when the service is extraordinary, I just think you should acknowledge it. On the night of my visit I went in alone and was seated in the lounge area so my server was the bartender and her name was Hannah and Hannah was spectacular!!!! To say that she made the whole evening better is an understatement so Hannah, thank you!!
Now the food, my favorite dish in the world, I am talking, if I was on death row my last meal would be Sausage and Peppers, when done right, nothing like it!!! Traditional Sausage and Peppers is an entree served over pasta with some garlic bread. Maggiano's has it as an appetizer, no pasta, just Sausage and Peppers so I almost did not order it which would have been tragic because it was decadently delicious, seriously delicious!!!!
The Sausage and Peppers appetizer could have been a meal but I still ordered an entree because I am a Yelp Foodie, it's what we do.
I ordered the Lasagna, I am a Lasagna snob, NOBODY can make Lasagna like my wife although my sister comes close so I am usually disappointed with restaurant Lasagna but on this day, I was treated to a wonderful, delicious, flavorful, meal that I will be eating many more times in the future!!!
The Lasagna was so good, I ordered one to go and had it for lunch the next day!!!
And, I should have lead with this, they have Dr. Pepper!!!
If you are looking for good Italian food please visit Maggiano's, you will not be disappointed!!!
Until next time my fellow Yelpers, ..... Live Local, ..... Be Local, ..... and whenever possible, ..... BUY LOCAL!!!!!!","Donut D.","Their kid's menu has to be one of the best value in town. For $7, kid gets an entree, drink plus a dessert and the best part is that the portion is large enough for an adult too. For the price, my kids' lunch for the next day is covered.
My favorite dish is their Braised Beef al Forno. The truffle peppercorn sauce is so yummy and completely coats the tender beef. The flavor is rich and took me right the truffle heaven.","Carlos B.","I've been several times but this is my only review of it.
I used Open Table to reserve a table but from the hostess reaction, seems like it wasn't received properly.
My date and I were seated momentarily, but near the kitchen. My date was so captivating and the service by Ernesto negated this location.
We settled on wine selections, and entrees. Marco's Dinner for Two - 2 entrees, 1 starter or 2 side salads, 1 dessert and 2 take-home entrees!
Each of choices were good. Nothing over the top, or to write home to Mom about.","Ron M.","Maggiano's gets a lot of crap, but the truth is that if you have kids (and I have 4) then they are going to love this place a lot more than a snobby ""authentic"" Italian restaurant. While I'd avoid the terrible flatbread pizza, most everything else is quite good and they have large enough portions that always result in bringing something home (plus some items come with a free extra serving to bring home).
You can't go wrong with the lasagna or spagetti with meatballs, but my favorite is the veal parmesan.
Great bread, decent wine, fun for the kids and everybody leaves with a full stomach - can't beat that.","Amandeep S.","I've been coming to Maggiano's for years for different occasions (graduations, anniversaries, Mother's Day, prom dinner, etc) - in fact, it's been nearly 9 years since my first visit and I must say that it has changed a lot. If I had left my review 7-8 years ago I would have easily given a 4, but after my experience in the last couple of years and especially a few weeks ago, I can't justify it. I have rated it a 3 here taking into consideration my many years of visits, but really my up-to-date rating is a 2.5.
I came in on a Sunday evening for my anniversary dinner with my husband and in-laws, having made a reservation ahead of time. Despite the reservation and the restaurant not being so busy, we had to wait for a table for 10-15 min. Once seated it took a while for our server to come and get us our drinks and then our orders. I have not had bad service here before in this way so I was pretty shocked.
The physical menu has also changed - it took some time to realize there wasn't just a back and front part to the menu, but rather a second page in between that you had to pull out. They also added a deal where if you order any classic or speciality pasta, you get to bring one classic home for free. This sounds like an amazing deal (which for the price it is) but to me it speaks volumes about quality of the food and the overall standard of the restaurant. It reminded me very much of Olive Garden.
Our food was also not as good as usual. I ordered the gnocchi, with added grilled chicken (what I typically order) and my husband got the manicotti (also a typical order for at least one of us), and we were both very disappointed in the food. Mine tasted very bland, with barely any sauce at all and the portion size was quite smaller than it used to be. The manicotti - tho very rich - also tasted bland and honestly too creamy with no flavor. My in-laws ordered salmon, which they liked, and the orichette pasta, which they didn't particularly care for.
The take home pastas we chose as part of the deal were the Rigatoni - only my husband ended up eating one of them, the other we threw away since it wasn't very tasty and we knew no one would eat.
I don't think I'll be back any time soon, which is a bummer as I've enjoyed this restaurant for nearly a decade :(","In Y.","I came back in almost 2 years to eat my favorite pasta, Rigatoni ""D"". The restaurant was fully packed on Sunday, and walk-in customers were asked to wait for at least 30 minutes to be seated. We were very glad that we made a reservation in advance via OpenTable app.
We got a booth table pretty quick and ordered a Rigatoni ""D"". They were running a special promotion - Choose a Specialty dish for today and any Classic for tomorrow. Throughout the promotion, we chose a Four-Cheese Ravioli.
It took more than 50 minutes to get the Rigatoni D. The server said there was a big party ahead of us which ended up causing significant delay on processing our order. It could have been better if the server informed us in a timely manner before I asked when my order would be served.
Pasta was rich and creamy - exactly what I wanted from the Rigatoni D. However, it is hard to say whether it was worth to wait about an hour to get that pasta. The four-cheese ravioli (frozen) for tomorrow was provided at the end when the check was given.","Krista R.","Had a great Christmas Eve dinner here with some friends. Most of the people at our table got a meal to eat at the restaurant, and one to take home, which was a great deal. I had a lobster carbonara, and it was amazing with tons, I mean TONS of lobster. It was incredibly busy and we did have to wait about 15 minutes despite having a reservation. Sometimes the waiter would disappear and not come back for a half an hour, and other times he was checking on us regularly. Overall the delicious food and lively atmosphere made for a great Christmas Eve dinner, would definitely come back here again for a special night.","Krystal L.","Came here on a Saturday for birthday brunch! It was pretty quite for a Saturday but I do know that it gets super busy during dinner- no reservations required even though we had one!
Their brunch was yummy!!! But the price for the brunch is a bit steep for me. We also ordered dessert but I would pass on the creme brûlée next time. I would 1000000% get those Benedict's again though and those POTATERS OOOOOOOWEEEE","Peg E.","Above and Beyond!
Friends and I just came back home after having a wonderful Sunday afternoon dinner out at Maggiano's. We so thoroughly enjoyed our selections, the service and the ambiance. Two of us could only finish half of our meal and asked for it to take home. We were so looking forward to enjoying the rest of it later. As it turns out our dinners were accidentally sent home with someone else. But, it didn't end there with an ""Oh, sorry.""
As an apology the manager ordered two complete dishes to replace what we lost and gave it to us nicely wrapped in a container to take home! Seriously, how many restaurants would do that for their patrons. Good deeds need to be recognized.","Ziyan B.","I have been to this place many times and haven't written a review. I love this place a lot both for its food and service. Their pasta is very fresh and delicious. None of the ones on the menu disappointed me ever. The seafood pasta was especially good, and they are very generous with the amount of seafood. One feature of the place is the service, servers are attentive and very friendly. The restaurant overall gives you a family feeling with quality and tasty food. I will come pretty often.","Giselle S.","The food was good! Our server Jessica was mediocre. She just kinda buzzed in and out. I've been a couple of times before. ThIs is my go to spot when I'm in town. The service previously has been impeccable and the food...always yummy.","Thomas J.","Went here for a business dinner with 8 other people. Service was excellent. Present without being obnoxious.
I'm not generally a fan of Italian places, but I really enjoyed this experience. My Beef Tenderloin Medallions were cooked perfectly and went very well with the portabella mushrooms and the mashed potato.
My fellow guests also expressed great satisfaction with their meals.
This place is huge, and a bit of a maze if you enter via the Lincoln Square mall.","Phattra V.","First time here and I wasn't really impressed. This place is okay. I don't think the quality of food matches the high prices. It's good food but nothing out of this world. Honestly, I'd pick Olive Garden over this place.
We got free bread for the table which was nice. Still warm which is always a plus. I got clam chowder to start. I feel like I would've enjoyed it more if it wasn't lukewarm. It tasted like Chunky Campbell's clam chowder that I was too impatient to warm to a boil. Meh. For my entree I ordered the Lobster Carbonara. It was tasty but I was too full to enjoy it since it felt like we waited forever to get our food. It was a tad bit salty tbh but good overall. Glad I have a meal for lunch tomorrow.
The service was nice. Our waiter Mr. Flowers was attentive and accommodating with our large group. Thank you all the extra bread and iced tea refills. Also thanks for not making us feel rushed since we stayed past closing time. If anything I feel like we were in a rush to leave.
If there's a next time, I'd probably get the ""for two"" dinner option since it seems like the only option that's worth the money. But with the amount of great restaurants around the area, I can and have had better pasta dishes, or food in general, elsewhere.","Daveena S.","Went in on a Friday night for a friends 21st birthday dinner! We also got seated right away as we did book online. (Booking online in advance is a smart idea because it seems this restaurant is usually busy)
The service was good, the wait for the food wasn't too long which is always nice!! Another thing I was very fond of is that they had everyone's food passed out around the same time, whereas other places do half the table than the other.
My friend I decided to do the meal for two: which was around 45$ including appetizer, pasta, pasta to-go, and dessert! For the price we got a lot of food and the quantity of each serving was more than enough! The overall quality of the food was tasty!!
And I wasn't aware that if you order a classic pasta you get the option to take one to-go which is super cool especially for families with kids!!
Also if you're wanting to come for an occasion we were allowed to bring our own cake and put on candles!
The overall experience was good, it was packed so it was a bit loud and crammed inside but despite that everything was good!
The only reason why I gave my review a 4-star was because we weren't given to order our dessert and considering there was ten of us, it is easy to forget so it's not the worst thing.."
"Soprano’s Antico","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sopranos-antico-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Carissa M.","Delish crust and fresh, flavorful ingredients on the pizza. Wings aren't bad, aren't great. Will definitely order pizza again. And you can't have pizza without wings so","Cora L.","Yuuuuuum! Ordered for delivery twice now. Both deliveries were on-time, with the food piping hot.
These are my faves:
- Spaghetti Pavia (the sausage is delicious!)
- House calzone (huuge portion)
Also good:
- Mozzerella sticks
- Caesar salad
- Mafia pizza
Wouldn't order again:
- Garlic bread","Travis A.","First visit to the restaurant after a long day across the peninsula. After much debate on where to eat, picky 10 year old daughter, we landed on Soprano's. This would be our first visit here....and, not our last. My wife and I couldn't believe that they have been open for two years. We ordered from the wine list, a bottle yielded $5 off the full bottle and the Montepulciano was good. We ordered two appetizers that were okay, caprese salad and toasted ravioli. My wife ordered the carbonara, picky daughters ordered fettuccine alfredo, and I ordered the gorganzola pancetta gnocchi. All the entrees were delicious and the server told us the sauces as well as the pasta are all made in house. For dessert, we did the massive tiramisu, and I would have liked to try the baklava or something else next time too. The bill was not bad for all of that, and the service was incredible.
We will be back...","Maryam J.","I wish I had pictures of our incredible meal here! Attentive and spectacular service. They offer a $$10 pasta dish on mondays when you order a drink which was such a value. We had the bolongese, dinner salad and margarita pizza; all of which were so yummy! Loved the ambiance, will definitely be back!","Tushar N.","It's a great neighborhood restaurant. They have reasonable prices for good, fresh food and outstanding service.
They don't charge a service fee or include a 20% tip in the bill. I mention this because many restaurants in Seattle have such invisible ""add-on.""","gerg g.","While searching for an Italian restaurant near or in West Seattle, Soprano's Antico came up on Yelp and so my wife and I decided to give it a try. The cheese ravioli and cheese tortellini were both very tasty. I would definitely return to try other dishes on their menu.","Matt T.","Good wine at good prices. REAL wood fired pizza. The wait staff is excellent and always friendly. Have a generous happy hour. Atmosphere is not too kitschy. Salads and main course makes any Olive Garden in America jealous. This place is an unknown star in west seattle! Great for date night or lunch before an afternoon movie across the street. Prices are great for this level of food taste and quality. There are gluten free options and the cheese and charcuterie (don't know the Italian word...) platter is really good. Kids eat free on Tuesday!
In addition to French and Italian wine, they serve local wine and beer.","Dustin P.","Came here for pizza and decided to try the goat Drunken Goat. It was a good pizza. I decided to get the gluten free crust and it was quite good. There a couple places in the area and I would return to this one.
It is in a good location and easy parking on a weeknight. decor seemed nice but I just got take out.","Wennie H.","Came here on a whim and left with every intention to come back. A few days ago, I walked past Antico wondering how long it had been here, it was empty and I was surprised since it looked new. My partner wanted pasta and we wanted something close but not our usual spots, in comes Soprano's Antico. A quick glance at their online menu solidified it for me.
We came in and there was one other table there, it was a group of 3 elderly men. It was very endearing. The decor is kitschy but everything was nice and spacious. The server/host/bartender was super nice and accommodating. I really liked her and how she treated everyone who walked in with so much genuine kindness.
Onto food, I had the Brooklynn calzone, baked with less cheese and more veggies. You also have the option to have it deep fried! She said it was really big and made for good leftovers, when it came to the table, I was pretty intimidated with the size...knowing I wouldn't finish it- I did though...despite everyone's disbelief. The calzone wasn't bad, I think had there been the regular amount of cheese it wouldn't have needed a little extra salt and pepper but it was good. The crust was really soft and crispy, the interior stayed hot the entire time I was eating. Gf ordered the spaghetti with marinara and it came with the best toasted garlic bread. The spaghetti was good, the noodles had a chew and the sauce had a nice sweetness to it. The restaurant boasts homemade pasta, so for the price points, it's worth it.","GJ R.","This is such a great place! Great food, service and ambiance. The personal touch makes it feel like you're visiting an old Italian homestead. Right now kids eat free on Tuesdays. We loved everything we ordered and will definitely be back.","Matt M.","Monday night Pasta special is a cant miss. Was underwhelmed by the size of the extra added meatballs but their flavor made up for it. Will
Be coming back soon.","Colette K.","5 STARS FOR KATE!! Our server goddess was so amazing! She took care of us so well while navigating around the other 7 tables, taking takeout orders, drinks...by herself. The pizza, meat lovers, was very meaty. Lots of good quality meats in a tangy red sauce.","Amanda D.","Always delicious! Great food, amazing dough, quick service! Love this place!!! Delivery great too!","Jesseann A.","Tried the mafia and the house calzone. Recommend the calzones for take out. They have a great house made dough!","Laura M.","What a treat! Delivered earlier than expected. Food was hot and delicious. Will order again and recommend.","Musha V.","I have ordered delivery twice now through the Yelp app and every time the pizza has been amazing. This last time I ordered the cheese special and as far as cheese pizza goes it really hit the spot. The cheese was fresh and high quality, the dough was the perfect texture of crisp and soft in parts and the sauce was slightly sweet creating a perfect contrast to the saltiness of the cheese. I also have ordered their tiramisu twice and it's one of the best I have had. I'm big on the cream part and not as much interested in all the cake. Their tiramisu is the right amount of cream to cake with the cake being moist with just enough espresso flavor. The amount they give you is more than double what I would normally receive at most restaurants. This is is definitely one of my favorite pizza places.","James P.","Outstanding Italian food at this place
Great pizza and pasta, great atmosphere and friendly staff. Great place for a quiet night out.","Kieu N.","I hope this place sticks around. It was pretty empty when we came in one a weekday during dinner. We had our pick of the tables in the place. The decor is cute and trendy. The food is pretty good. House made pastas and wood fired pizzas were great, and their marinara sauce was awesome.
Their tiramisu was pretty delicious too. Perfect balance of the espresso and sweetness.
They've been open for about 6 months. I know there's lots of pizza places in West Seattle to choose from, but I hope this place gets enough of a following to stay in business.","Cara W.","Just got this delivered through the grubhub app. Had the Greek pizza, dinner salad, and baklava. I'm pretty impressed with it. It was quick delivery and delicious. I'll definitely be trying it again.","Shelby M.","We brought our infant and grandfather in on a Sunday night and had a great time. The staff was super nice and accommodating for our baby. The food was great and we left happy and full."
"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Christy N.","Like OMG I've discovered a cool, tasty fun lil hidden gem.
Like the pizzas are is so good. Kinda cramp/crowded as you get into the door. But like it's a separate seating section which has a good space.
The ladies are super super friendly. You know the type that should be working in customer service because they have the personality and attitude for it. Oh back to the food, well the pizza pies can generally feed 2 or if your super hungry you can if you want to admit it chow down the whole thing. I like that the menu isn't super complicated or over whelming with options.
The only negative is that it is in some what awkward spot and it is tough to find in the evening. Wish there was a big lighted sign. The neighborhood lacks good lighting and gets really dark like darker then usually at night for an area with restaurants.","Kelsey B.","Y'all. I LOVE PIZZA..... unfortunately, I didn't love Delancey
Two of us quickly grabbed a table on Saturday night around 6PM hungry and ready to feast. Let me start by saying the service was excellent. Our waitress was attentive, friendly and quick. We grabbed a nice bottle of red to enjoy with the pies (reasonably priced ~$50). My husband got a Margherita and I went for the Romana. Again, service was super quick and our pies came out quickly.
Unfortunately they just didn't taste great. The Margherita was burnttt (see pic). These wood fire pies usually take under 5 minutes to cook and I feel like for this kind of place they should have just made another pie real quick rather than serving us up something this burnt. And the Romana was so salty it was not even edible.
We are been looking forward to coming to Delancey for awhile now. I've heard such great things about this spot and it looks like a lot of fellow yelpers also agree that this place is good, we must have had an off night. There are a lot of great pies in town and Delancey just isn't something I would trek over to check out again.","Lee G.","It would certainly help Delancey if the first person you meet, the hostess, was even slightly polite. But as can be referenced by several Yelp reviews - the hostess puts herself above the establishment and the patrons by treating interested customers with nothing but attitude and a power trip.
Our waitress was not much better, and instead of fire we got ice. She didn't smile once during any interaction and seemed humorless and unhappy to be at Delancey in general. At the end of our meal when my friend mentioned that the pizza should be labeled as spicy, she gave no apology and instead listed the ingredients.
To top it off, the pizza wasn't very good. Not that Delancey should be given a pass for rude behavior by making up for it with delicious pizza, but their pizza isn't even worth dealing with the unfriendly vibe.","Klarke C.","Delaney is a lovely neighborhood delight tucked in Ballard with some of the best pizza in Seattle (if not the best).
We were promptly seated without a reservation so if you're not able to make one online don't let that sway you from coming! I ordered the half Brooklyn, half bacon and onion with added mushrooms! It was cheesy crispy deliciousness","Tabatha J.","Not sure why so many people rave about this place.
We arrived and put our name on the list. Went next door to grab an app and drink while we waited 30-40 min which was very convenient.
We got notified via text out table was ready and we're seated. It's a bit crazy at the door trying to get past people waiting and people trying to get in the list.
Our table was great and we ordered our pizza 1/2 bacon onion 1/2 sausage.
We'd thought about ordering 2 and I'm happy we didn't. The edges of the pizza were not lightly charred and beautiful from coming from the oven, all the edges were charred black. When I went to slide a piece off the pan lol the toppings slid off and went on the table. The center didn't seem quite cooked- more soppy. Also I've heard great things about the flavor of the dough. I'm not sure if it's because I didn't have a crust to taste but it lacked in flavor.
I didn't leave satisfied and was still hungry but decided id rather go to Cornuto or another nearby oven fired thin crust pizza place.
Customer service was good
Was pricey for what you get.","Emily I.","I am really disappointed to have to write this review, as one of my good friends has been RAVING about the food Delancey's and I was really looking forward to trying it.
My party showed up on a Saturday evening and of course Delancey's was busy. There was a table available outside so we sat down and waited to be served. Within a few minutes we were told (rather rudely) that they were not serving outside that night because it was about to rain.
No big deal, we decided we either wanted to put our name on the list or order a few pizzas to go and take our chances with the weather (chairs were still out and there was no sign saying they weren't serving outside). We decided to split up our party and while some went in to order the pizzas, some went to order drinks from next door to enjoy while we were waiting.
We were refused the ability to order drinks, order pizzas, or put our name on the list. Not only were we completely off put by that, the hostess told us to ""go across the street if we wanted a drink"" and basically kicked us out. Another hostess attempted to apologize for her colleague's behavior, and allow us to order pizzas to go, but it was far too late for that.
I certainly hope the TERRIBLE customer service isn't a regular occurrence at Delancey's, but I probably won't be back to find out.","Deb N.","Truly good pizza! All made from scratch ingredients. The crust is thin and crisp. Staff were all super helpful and nice. Looking forward to next visit here!","Brandon B.","Best budget date spot in all of Seattle without sacrificing ambience. Come early and put your name in so you can enjoy a drink at the conjoined bar called Essex. We are pretty easy to please when it comes to pizza, we argue about toppings so we often get two pies and leave FULLER THAN FULL. My wife and I have been here countless times and enjoy it very much, if you don't want to wait then check it out on a weekday. Don't be dismayed by any bad reviews due to the poor planning of some other yelpers before trying a restaurant, the staff has always been kind and friendly.","Sheryl K.","The boyfriend and I were craving pizza for dinner. He wanted to try this place out so we decided to head over.
Street parking was a little challenging to find in that area, but we managed to find a spot fairly close by.
It's a pretty nice spot--not too big or small. They have a bar, a bunch of tables, and two restrooms. It was dimly lit but bright enough to comfortably eat and have nice conversation.
We each ordered a glass of wine and shared their mushroom pizza.
The two main reasons why I decided to give this place 3 stars is because the pizza was just alright. Our crust was a little burnt, but it wasn't a deal breaker. But I was hoping that the flavor would compensate for the semi-burnt crust. Unfortunately it didn't and it kind of bummed us out.
Second, the server, although pretty friendly when she first took our order, seemed either too busy with other tables, or maybe was preoccupied? But my boyfriend had noticed that when she came to our table to check on us, she walked up to our table to ask how we were doing, but was looking elsewhere and didn't give us any eye contact. It was weird enough that my boyfriend noticed. I guess for me, if the server doesn't really want to check up on our table, I'd rather they just drop the check off than half ass the acknowledgement.
After leaving the restaurant I was still craving something--anything to fulfill my flavor craving. I wasn't all that hungry but still felt like I needed something. So we ended up going to Jack N the Box to top the night off.
Can't say it was the best meal, but it wasn't horrible. But I can say that I'm happy that we at least tried it. Maybe it was the type of pizza that we ordered, who knows? Unfortunately, I can't say that we'll be returning anytime soon.","AJ K.","After a day of traveling and sightseeing from Portland to Ballard, we were looking for a relaxing evening with comfort food. My girlfriend suggested pizza, which led me to discover Delancey, just a few blocks from our Airbnb. It couldn't have been a better situation.
Great lighting, stylish decor, chill wait staff with super speedy service. We had some great wine and local beers and enjoyed the classic Margherita pizza. The real highlight of the experience was a delicious homemade chocolate chip cookie á la mode.
If you're wanting to continue the night check out the bar at Essex right next door for chill cocktails.","Andrew E.","Pizza is fire. Best pizza in Seattle along with bar del corso. Less is more when it comes to the amount of toppings on pizza and Delancey gets that.","Eva C.","We have been meaning to try out Delancey for a while 1. because we live really close and 2. we've heard the raves. Tonight was finally the night! We decided to order take out so we could enjoy our meal at home with our dog. We called in to make a to go order and the woman over the phone had a very rude tone and told us we cannot order over the phone we must come in person. This is pretty odd to me because the point of ordering to go is so you don't have to wait at the restaurant. We luckily live about 3 blocks away so we shrugged it off and went in to order. Once arriving there it was just a series of issues and utter rudeness from the hostess.
1 - messes up order; we ordered the sausage and the bacon and onion pizzas (2 separate pizzas on the menu), she charged us for a sausage pizza with bacon and onion.
2 - miss charges me; first charged us for 1 pizza with add-ons then charges us for 3 pizzas.
3 - messes up the void; doesn't void the original incorrect order; total jumped from $25 to $66
4 - fixes the void but doesn't provide receipt for proof
5 - doesn't acknowledge me when I ask for proof, just grabs the receipt and hands it to me; very cold, unfriendly, terrible customer experience.
The pizza itself was good. Nothing mind blowing or particularly unique. Perhaps it was over hyped to me, perhaps this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm giving this place a two stars because I was satisfied with my pizzas.
I've gone on this long without having Delancey and I'm fine continuing on the rest of my life not eating it again. I expected a much better customer experience and I'm highly disappointed.","Kim H.","A delayed review, as it's been two years since I visited Delancey (I live in Virginia) but I haven't been able to stop thinking about this place since my visit to Seattle.
Made reservations for our anniversary here after seeing a favorite chef post a photo from Essex (cocktail bar next door) and I'm so glad I found this place. The jersey salad and pizza may seem simple enough but truly, I would book a trip back across the country just to eat here again.
We tried Essex on two other occasions of this trip and not only were the cocktails incredible, the small(er) menu delicious, but the service was friendly and inviting. Our waitress the first night gave us a handwritten list of her must-see Seattle recommendations which we loved.
After visiting, I read the Delancey book, which I also recommend and loved being able to read the behind the scenes of how the restaurant was born and 5/5 would recommend the restaurant, the bar, and the book.","Laura R.","When it was determined that I would be visiting my friend in Seattle, I knew I had to try out Delancey. I've been a fan of Orangette since college, and I remember reading about this place when they opened and wanting to check it out. We took an Uber here, and it was a cozy and intimate spot, which I didn't mind because I was there with one of my good friends. So maybe my review is a rad biased because I already liked the food that Molly made on her blog.
I ended up ordering the Hot Salami pizza, which was soooo good. Beautifully presented, with slightly charred and bubbled topping. The freshness from the pizza seriously complemented the slightly sweet burnt edges, which was surprising to me. It was definitely large enough to split between two people or to just split up for a few meals as I did. :)
All in all, it was a very solid pizza, cooked with a deliciously chewy crust and stacked with tons of meat. I would love to go back again the next time I'm in the area.","J E L.","Really solid crunchy crust (thinking Lucali) wood fired pies. Not as enticing as Lucali on flavor (less intense) and texture, but super enjoyable.","Megha T.","Came here after an entire day of gorging myself, and man do I regret that because I wish I could have eaten three of these pizzas by myself!
My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night after he read Molly Wizenberg's book and recommended we do dinner here. Despite its apparent fame, the restaurant was pretty empty for Saturday night at 8:30 pm but I'm not complaining since we were expecting a moderate wait!
We were immediately seated and our server was attentive and helpful. We ordered their hot salami pizza ($17) and the chocolate chip cookie ($3.50), as well as a pint of beer each. I can't remember which kinds we got but they were perfectly cold, contrasting with the oven-hot pizza.
Also yes - the pizza, oh baby. Dough was perfectly cooked, a bit tangy from the sourdough, and the sauce and cheese are divine. I wouldn't consider myself someone who loves pizza (more of a tacos gal) but this pizza made me consider it. The hot salami was fantastic, as well. If you're hungry, definitely get your own pizza! Even if you don't finish, the leftovers will be good.
As for the chocolate chip cookie, either get it in cookie dough or skip it and choose something else. After the amazing pizza, I had high expectations for it but it was a bit of a letdown because it was brittle and bitter.","Don S.","Outstanding pizza. One of two great pizza restaurants in Seattle. Evviva and Delancey are the very best in the Northwest.","Ha T.","Long ago, I would've give them a five-star with a rambling review on how unbeatable they are. This was my all-time favorite pizza place. The crust was simply perfect: a balance of chewy and crackly-ness.
Now the crust is still as good as ever, but they burnt it quite a bit on our last visit. They replaced the interesting toppings (remember the kimchi) with generic ingredients. They also made a common mistake of overloading their pizza with cheese and sauces. It turned a once-beautiful crust very soggy.
Maybe I judged them too harshly, because they're held to a much higher standard in my mind. What changed for them? New management? Complacency? It could just be a really bad day, too.","Camille J.","As someone who grew up on New York thin crust pizza, I'd say this is definitely some of the best I've been able to find in Seattle. My friend and I tried the bacon and onion pizza and the crimini mushroom pizza, and we both enjoyed the crimini pizza a lot more. The red sauce wasn't out of this world, so the simplicity of the crimini pizza was just right. Plenty of mushrooms for a nice umami flavor. Unfortunately, the middle of the crimini pizza was soggy. Still have a little more thin crust perfection to strive for.
This is certainly a popular restaurant. It was pretty bumpin even when we arrived at 9pm on a weeknight, and people were still coming in after us. Regardless, the service was excellent. Our water glasses were constantly being filled up (we arrived at the restaurant thirsty and were constantly guzzling down the water), and our waitress was prompt and friendly. Would recommend!","Mar B.","Good but definitely not the best pizza I've ever had- nor the best in the country. Go to the east coast or hidden gems in Sedona, AZ for that.
But know I'm biased because I like my pizza to have a lot of flavor.
Ordered the mushroom pie with pepperoni but when it
Came only had mushrooms, no pepperoni :( - waitress came around after 6-7 mins to check in on us, but honestly we were starving and waiting for our order to be corrected/remade was not worth the time.
Mushrooms were almost dry, like the way you eat them dry in a salad bar. They're kind of lightly cooked in olive oil, but almost just for a second. The pie was white with no red sauce, cheese and mushroom. Crust was white and kind of bland. Service from front hostess and our hostess was great, but can't make up for a boring pizza.
The addition of any kind of meat could have saved it, but alas white pie with semi dry mushrooms it was."
"Tropea Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tropea-ristorante-italiano-redmond-2?osq=Italian+Food","Samantha G.","This restaurant was great. It was a little busy on a Friday night but they sat us at the bar and let us drink wine while we waited. The atmosphere was great, very professional and authentic. Definitely felt like a true Italian restaurant. I got gnocchi pasta and it was fantastic. Also their wine selection is amazing.
The only issues I had was we got seated at a really really small table. There was enough room for the bread basket and drinks or just our entree and drinks. So very crowded. And it can be a bit spendy. But the food and drink is so worth it.
Perfect for a romantic date night","Melissa W.","I've been twice now and both times were FANTASTIC experiences. Restaurant itself is on the end of a strip mall but there is plenty of parking. The restaurant is small and there is usually a wait at dinner on weekends so plan ahead. They don't take reservations.
I got the italian sausage rigatoni both times and it was SO GOOD. My SO got a chicken dish that was excellent as well. The second time we came it was for a birthday and they figured it out and gave my SO tiramisu with a candle. So nice of them and honestly the BEST tiramisu i've had.
Complimentary first bread basket served with olive oil and garlic. Menu is extensive with lots of options!
Service was great and quick! Friendly waiters and the owner is around too!
Overall a great restaurant and we will most definitely be back!","Jen H.","Tropea has a great selection of Italian dishes including entrees, pasta, and pizza. My partner picked up dinner for us on the way home from work. I ordered the Spaghetti Calamari and my partner ordered the Rigatoni Salsiccia. Both were very good and the portion size was very generous- we both ate only half of our meals. We split a Caesar salad.
The food here is quite tasty and I would definitely go back to try some of their other dishes. The only other thing I think worth noting about this restaurant is that it is not cheap. If you are okay with that and want good Italian food, then this is definitely a great place to go. A good portion of their pasta dishes run almost $25 which makes it a place that I cannot go to often. However, when I do go, I will most certainly be happy with what I order.","Tingting W.","I really liked my pasta! If you like creamy and rich pastas, this is the spot for you. My friend got the Bolognese and hated it. The restaurant itself is pretty old. So it's not a cute trendy vibe. But overall food was good (for me) and the service was good!","Andrew S.","I rated this four? What is wrong with me.
Checking in again. Went with the house veal. After ordering wine, the server who knows us well at this point brought in a different bottle.
His recommendation was perfect. Absolutely mouthwatering combination.
Every single facet of this restaurant is perfection.","Cindy F.","TLDR: wordy menu. More pasta than meat.
When was the last time you've read a novel? The menu is a mini novel. There is so much text! I appreciate the descriptions of items but a few pictures to alleviate the eyes would be nice. It also takes a while to read everything before you order because there's just so much to read. Not being Italian doesn't help since the names of each dish are Italian so you are forced to read the description. Maybe I'm just lazy but really I'm just hungry.
Very dimly lit so picture quality will be poor but it's a good romantic setting. Check out those giant frames with the wine bottles!
Service: wait to be seated, table service, order at the table, your check will be brought to you.
Complimentary bread and oil: bread is served cold and is in large slices. I like the chewiness of the bread but it's otherwise tasteless without the oil. Generous portion of oil with LOTS of garlic.
Rigatoni Amatriciana: rigatoni is great but there isn't very much pancetta--it felt like just pasta and sauce really. The meat to pasta ratio wasn't well balanced in this dish. Loads of sliced onion and tomato sauce though. A little too much onion in my opinion but the sauce is good.","Aparna S.","I was excited to find an Italian restaurant close to my house with good reviews. When we arrived, there was a wait so that was a good sign. When the food came, I was thoroughly disappointed. The Margherita pizza tasted like school lunch. No sign of fresh mozzarella and only shreds of basil. For dinner, I got the truffle chicken. For a $30 CHICKEN dish, I was expecting to be mind blown but I could taste no sign of truffle. It was either masked with the pounds of butter or none was actually in there. The pasta was bland as well because it comes with the same sauce as the chicken ($5 up charge to change the sauce). Service was good but I don't think we will be returning.","Derek M.","As an east-coast Italian, I hold Italian food to a very high standard! Tropea does a good job with their pastas - I've had the linguine vongole and gnocchi pomodoro and was satisfied with both meals. The portion sizes are a little small compared to the price, but you will not leave still hungry. The table bread is very mediocre - they should think about baking their own bread or at least serving it warm to customers! The olive oil dipping cup is full of spices and garlic which helps offset the blandness of the bread. Not the best Italian food I've had on the Eastside, but certainly not the worst.","Travis N.","Borderline 1/2. Went here as my Thai place next door was closed.
Over priced. Had the pollo limone - sauce was soupy and literally tasted like the bile you barf up at the end of a good puking session. 26 for the plate and barely any pasta on the plate - maybe $3 of product on the plate. Service was very slow with only half the tables full inside. Inside was very hot as well - no AC and actually outside felt colder when I left.
Also if the place has to force you to buy $8 of product you're in trouble. I have never seen a ""minimum"" purchase on any Italian restaurant menu.
I will not be returning.","Nora S.","Pleasantly surprised. I usually find Italian food overpriced and uninteresting, but the pasta at this place is solid. Lots of vegetarian choices. The marinara sauce is full of flavors. My dish was hearty without feeling too heavy, a problem I have with lots of Italian restaurants. The price seems a little high, but the portions are very generous. This is traditional, basic Italian at its best. Can't wait to try the Sicilian pizza!","Mani M.","Came here for dinner with my good friend from out of town and we both love food and we yelped Italian food around the area a few came up but, this one caught our foodie antenna. We decided to check it out.
I couldn't be more pleased with the service & food here. It's my new fave creamy pasta (Italian) restaurant. I swear the seafood Fetti was so F*n bomb!!!! We got complimentry dessert too. It was such a delight to be service with care! Deff will be coming back. & will spread the word of love of this place, will recommend it to friends!!","Lisa F.","Tropea is our go-to date night spot on the Eastside, as well as great place to bring out of town guests due to the extensive menu options (particularly the pasta!).
Great, friendly service, options to sit inside or outside and authentic, southern Italian cuisine make this our fave Italian restaurant on the Eastside. The patio area is small, with approximately 5 tables, but is a comfortable little Oasis and nicely shielded from the parking area with shrubbery.
So far we have tried the caprese (with burrata, if available), calamari impanantate, lasagna, ravioli Mari Monte, a risotto special with seafood and tiramisu. Would highly recommend all. Tiramisu was the best I have had, including in Italy. The calamari was lightly breaded and fried and not too greasy. We have twice ordered it with the spicy tomato sauce included with the calamari diavola and would highly recommend. I often dream about the amazing flavor and creaminess of the ravioli Mari Monte and it is probably my favorite dish.
While the prices may be a touch high, we found the portions to be massive and would need to pack up at least half our entree to go.
Delish- go check it out !!","Sarah A.","What a delightful spot for a dinner out in Redmond! It's a super popular spot during peak times (dinner and weekend dinners especially) so come early or expect to wait.
Portions are generous, service is attentive and food is well prepared. We tried both a special and a classic menu item and loved them both. We shared a salad which was easily big enough for two. The dessert was the least favorite part so I'll probably skip that next time but all in all this is a great spot! Sometimes these ""suburban institutions"" don't live up to their reputation but Tropea totally does - a must visit if you're in the area and worth a trip if you want some classic Italian dishes in a kitchu restaurant with friendly family feel.","Melanie B.","I love the ambience, the service. The place filled up with the first hour of opening. The ingredients are fresh, cooked to order. The noodles on both our dishes were perfecto al dente. Hubs had the veal- it was tender and flavorful. I had the spaghetti agli olio- it was dynamite!!!!
Chocolate mouse was delicious, but too rush for just one- it should be shared. Same with the chocolate torte - and hubs had an after dinner espresso and said it was great.
Wonderful late afternoon date!","Kimberly Y.","Came around 7pm for dinner on Sunday night and they were packed. Waited about 20 minutes to get seated. As we got seated I was overwhelmed with the smell of parmesan. They really like it here! We also got a free side of sliced bread with olive oil soaked in garlic. It was okay but wish the bread was a bit less dense and not cold.
I ordered the Gina Maria and bf got the lasagna. If you don't like parmesan make sure to let them know as they top it on all dishes. Lasagna comes in a cast iron and is piping hot. It was still bubbling while being served. The Gina Maria was very good and portions large. Had to pack leftovers. Service was good and attentive. I enjoyed the food here quite a bit and would definitely recommend!","Don S.","This place is wonderful. The food is outstanding and portions are amazing. Place is very busy for good reason. The owner knows good service. He's warm and friendly but not intrusive.
We've been back several times.","L P.","My friend and i had dinner here last night. The food was wonderful!! Greens in salad were crisp and fresh. Left with enough for a second meal. We will be back. An absolute gem!!","Gary B.","A quaint rustic place with an excellent wine list.
Service and food quality is excellent. I had the chicken Gina Maria and it is one of the best chicken dishes I have ever had. Next time I visit I will be back.","David L.","I'm kinda disappointed in the service from my server from last night's dinner. It was my first time in Seattle and my first time to this restaurant. I got recommended to this place and sadly I was disappointed. The food was good but my server wasn't very friendly. I tried to ask him questions about the menu and he was really short with me. I then kept thanking him for service when appetizer got delivered and the food as well. The server never said one word. I mean my entrée was 26 bucks and it was kinda cold. Anyway, I love Italian food but I'll just have to find another spot.","Josh M.","Tucked into a small strip mall, this place is a hidden gem. Delicious food, wonderful service and a decent value!
I had the Ravioli Francesco without mushrooms and was super happy I made that choice. I would definitely recommend it!"
"Saltoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/saltoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Christina S.","This is our home away from home. We enjoy all the food and so it seems unnecessary to itemize what we like (everything!). Good drinks and wine list too.
We have gotten to know the owners and staff and they are always asking for feedback. They care about their customers and work very hard.
The only improvement I would suggest someday is if there is a way to muffle the noise of conversation. But that is a good sign that their customers are so happy and comfortable that the animation carries through the place when it is busy. They always have nIce blues or jazz or other music on low in the background and a silent tv with your favorite sports in the bar.
We have been to Brunch a few times too and all I have tasted is delicious as well.","B. Marie J.","This is a nice neighborhood restaurant/bar. I usually call in my special order of pizza and am able to pick it up within 15-20 minutes. The staff is great - they get to know the regulars and always have a warm greeting for regulars and non-regulars a like.
The bar is a good size (medium-to large) in a square shape with plenty of space and it has a TV (usually with sports) and a decent sized restaurant area that I often see friends or family dining. In the summertime there's outside seating as well. The parking isn't bad (except on a Friday night) but street parking is also available in the area.
I'd recommend this spot for comfort food or small special occasions.","Laura V.","Their brunch menu sounded so good, so came here hungry on a Sunday morning. First, I really liked the interior and the seating arrangements. I had read the reviews before and knew it was a slower paced restaurant. So I came prepared with The NY Times.
There were about four or five other tables, so it was pretty slow there. My server was prompt and helpful.
I ordered a crab frittata and beignets. Opened the paper and started to read. The beignets came out after 20 minutes. They were good and I was hungry. They came with a berry sauce that made them a lot better.
But you don't want to fill up on doughnuts or you get that sickish feeling of being hungry and full at the same time. So, waited for my frittata.
It was another half hour before my food came. I'm almost finished reading the paper and reduced to reading sections of the paper I never read. And, starving. I wish I would have been checked on, to give me an idea of the status of my order. In a fairly empty restaurant, an hour wait for breakfast food seems too long.
The crab frittata here came in a cute cast iron skillet. But a cast iron skillet when I cook, is to impair a nice crust on the food. This cast iron skillet rendered the frittata into a brown scorched mass. When I saw that it was overheated, I tried to immediately scrape it all out of this pan, to stop the cooking process and see if I could save it. No, the entire sides of the egg had formed a stubborn hard crust on the pan. I almost wanted to cry with disappointment. I so wanted to eat that frittata. But even in my hungry state it was inedible. My server offered to have the kitchen make another one, but I can't wait another hour.
The frittata came with a nice fruit salad, including blueberries. But please take off those little brown stem parts off the top of the blueberries. It makes me think they were not washed, as you would notice the brown tops.
Came hungry. Waited an hour. Food very over cooked. Left hungry. This equals a sad experience.","Nora J.","This place has some potential. The staff was very friendly and it was done well. They make a really weird old fashioned. The bartender told they did and interesting take on the manhattan but not the old fashioned. I couldn't drink it and that's saying a lot. I would never order it again. The decor is nice and warm. I ordered the butternut squash ravioli and it was odd too. It was really sweet, almost like sweet potatoes. I knew asking for salt wouldn't help so I ate it. The mushrooms and sauce helped to take the sweetness down a notch but it's not the savory still I'm used too. The pasta was cooked well. Overall, I can't say I drive here as a visitor again but the story behind the new ownership is cool.","Eric D.","Great food for reasonable price. I highly recommend the steak with Caper salsa verde, and the butternut squash pasta for entrees. You can't go wrong with the spicy prawns or chick peas as a appetizer.
A huge shout out to Christie, the gm, and her wonderful team. They make the stay even better.","Jamie P.","This is not a place to eat if you are avoiding sugar- it's seriously in almost everything","Kristin H.","Meh. It was okay. Two ladies seated themselves and got chewed out by the waitress. They replied we waited up front - no one was there.
The food was good but we were not offered bread, the portions were tiny and there was no salad or side veggies. We weren't asked if wanted ""to start with a salad"". I expect to take leftovers home in an Italian restaurant.
The decor is pretty lacking, and seating looks like home made benches - for how expensive the food is, the whole place could use some improvement.","Jacqueline A.","Came in for brunch with my husband today, and we were not disappointed! I ordered the French toast and my husband got the salmon Benedict (which is probably the healthiest Benedict we've ever had, as it comes on a bed of quinoa instead of english muffin - we loved every bite of it - HIPSTER ALERT!)
Prices were good, we didn't need to wait for a table, and there was a fantastic selection of brunchy cocktails.
Looks like we found a new regular brunch spot! Thanks, Saltoro!","Adriana G.","I love it. At first I wasnt sure about this place but the food turn out to be pretty good and the staff are very nice and friendly","Keelan H.","It's ok. The braised short rib was good. Smaller portion. I wasn't really impressed with the menu. I tried the clams. They were eh. Bread was eh. Everything else was alright. Server was nice. We had a good time. I was underwhelmed.","Arthur A.","Salt marries Oracular Spectacular leaving it be legally binded as Saltoro, a spectacular italian showcase.

Come for Future Reflections and know that it's offers will leave you wanting more upon your grand departure.","Allen U.","This place just gets better with age and is just dog gone good--as in finger licking good--consistently serving great food at reasonable prices in a comfortable Seattle ""shabby chic"" decor (this is fun, not stuffy restaurant with artsy sconches and old style leaded glass lighting). You can go small plates or the larger ""hunger plates"" --Try the awesome (fall off the --bone gone ) ""Braised Short Rib"" with a grainy brown rice and arugula with balamic dressing @ $22 or the equally awesome ""Wild Mushroom and Proscuitto Pasta"" @ $15 or just ""pick um""--you can't go wrong here--but wait there's more--the ""Fallen Chocolate (made to order-- split it) Cake dessert is worth every calorie @ $8 and the ""leaded"" custom made Coffee @ $2.75 will keep the evening fires burning--
Insider hint-- come early (5pm opening) to avoid the crowds or try the awesome bar stand where all the action happens--the counter here is large enough to seat people on both sides--(you can only sit on one side)--so great space with no wait--and leave the Dog home--so ""you can lick the plate""--cheers Al","Kim P.","Attended a birthday dinner for family and was excited to see what this place was all about since I've driven so many times and never stopped in. Also looking at the reviews, which there are a good mix of them, I couldn't wait to try the truffle fries!!
Walking in, the place is a little dated and dark....a little update remodel would do some good? The seating accommodations were good considering we where a pretty large party but access was limited so if you needed to get up be mindful of where you choose to sit.
Menu was good, I had checked it out before we came to have an idea of what to order and looked at reviews etc. As the food came out most was ok, not as great as what I expected and the portions are on the smaller side. Our waitress and servers were sub par, handing dishes to the closest person to them instead of asking or knowing who ordered what.
Overall it was an okay experience BUT let me add that we where told to be quiet twice during the last hour they were open, on a Saturday night??","Amber H.","Best brunch in town! Crab frittata with truffle potatoes, avocado mouse on a bed of prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella with balsamic glaze, and fantastic bloody Mary's....I'm so happy that one of our favorite restaurants have expanded to brunch! The word isn't out yet, so there won't be any wait...not until people realize what they're missing!","Walter P.","Good food, service, and ambience. The roast chicken is terrific.","Hoover L.","Love this place. Service is always on point, the portions are perfect and dining etiquette very good. It's our local spot... I wouldn't mind if they raised the prices a bit to ensure that they stay around... highly recommended...","Lois C.","Saltoro has so much to offer! Not only does it offer great food and customer service, it seems to carry great stories in peoples hearts. Went in around 4:45, which is 15 minutes before opening, I was waiting outside and I have met Some wonderful people waiting as well. One gentlemen told me that its his favorite spot with his gf, and that they visit at least 3 times a month. Another couple who were waiting as well, told me that its their tradition to sit by the mirror located at the corner. Regulars here, seems to have special traditions and stories with their loved ones. Before even entering, I felt a cozy vibe.
Ordered the Caesar salad, calamari, house-made fennel sausage pizza, and finally the butternut squash ravioli. All the foods came out at an prompt timing and all very delicious. Calamari was interesting because it had pieces of chick peas. Not complaining, just commenting. (Hehe)
Being one of the first to enter the restaurant, I was surprised to see how pack this place got middle of my dinner. This place almost seems under rated by yelpers and its almost like a secret! I am happy I found this gem! I totally recommend everyone to give this restaurant a try, and you might create a special tradition of your own here. Overall, great experience and I'm excited to come back soon again.","Doug L.","Hadn't been here for a while and wanted to try someplace new for brunch. Food was just ok, mediocre to poor service. Sat down in a near empty restaurant. Server took our drink order and we waited. And waited. No bartender. After about ten minutes they arrived and we ordered. And waited, and waited, and waited. Our server had disappeared. Just as we were getting ready to leave, the food finally arrived. Meh. 3/4 of the way through she came back to check on us and took our second drink order. She did take one dish off because it was so salty. Will we go back? For brunch, definitely not. Other than the Bloody Marys, not worth it.","Rick S.","Ok. So my requirement for a good place to eat is the number of cars in a parking lot. We had to park 2 blocks away. Good start! Went with the family. My son just finished college yesterday. Celebration dinner. I got the lamb burger. Not what I expected. The flavor? Peppery, spicy sweet. What was it. So good! It was some Tunisian aioli pepper thing. Never tasted anything like it. With my tap apple cider. What a contrast in flavors! The bread we ordered for appetizer was right out of the oven hot and fresh and delicious! Compliments all around the table from the family about the high quality of the food. Fresh, seasoned well and great! Service was excellent for such a packed place as well. The atmosphere was marvelous too. Dark wood. Pleasant lighting. Wine bottles for walls. Give it a try. You'll like it! I'll be back!","Elizabeth M.","Visited Saltoro on a Monday night. The food was very tasty and the waiter had great recommendations for dishes we should try. The place seemed under-staffed so it took a little longer than expected to get our water or have our order taken but we didn't mind. I was disappointed to hear they don't have happy hour and are only open for dinner. There is potential for weekend bunch or a great happy hour menu if they wanted to expand a bit."
"Bistro Baffi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-baffi-burien-2?osq=Italian+Food","Mb H.","Super good. Had no idea this place was here, it's not really near anything but worth the trip. I've been to Italy and this place was actually as close to authentic as I've experienced in Seattle. Big servings, decent price, adequate service. Went on a weeknight so it was dead but I can see this place hopping on the weekends. Parking lot seems like it can get full quick if they're busy and some spots are reserved for the quickiemart next door. I'd definitely go back.","Duncan B.","*** THEIR TERRIBLE FOOD SAVED MY LIFE ***
This once-respected establishment has cratered under new management:
* rancid olive oil served with bread
* halibut obviously defrosted, came out looking like a cheetah had gnawed on it and discarded it (also: it was sitting in a half centimeter of flavorless oil - HARDLY the promised ""cognac reduction""
* lasagna was a watery soup
* plates were searingly hot yet pasta was somehow cold?
The charming and polite waitress would have been a lone ""pro"" except she described all of our dishes inaccurately and only carried one plate at a time. It took four trips back to the kitchen to bring out our two entrees and sides.
However I must admit a debt of gratitude to this restaurant. Their high-fat and rancid food made me feel so ill that I went to the emergency room later that night, where they discovered I needed an emergency gall bladder removal. Thank you Bistro
Baffi!","Amandeep S.","I don't give out 1-2 ratings lightly. But I really do feel compelled to give this place that after my experience on Friday.
My husband and I came for dinner around 8:40pm. It wasn't really busy at the time, we probably missed the dinner rush; only about 3 other tables had people at them. We were seated quickly in the more quiet area to the right. The ambiance was super nice, with a little fake fireplace and it definitely has a romantic feel to it. One problem here though: it was too dark, we could barely read our menus.
Our server didn't come to our table for about 10 minutes after we sat down, and forgot to give us water, so we had to ask for it. There were quite a few things she missed that night but she was actually new so it wasn't all her fault - she was really nice and friendly!
But here were the main problems:
1) Our food took about 35-40 min to come out. It was nearly 9:30pm by the time we received it. I ordered the lobster ravioli and my husband ordered the carbonara (it wasn't on the menu but since he saw it in other yelp photos/reviews, he asked the server and she found out that it was something that could be ordered)
2) when the food did come out, both my husband's spaghetti noodles and my ravioli were not cooked all the way. I love Italian food and know that it's supposed to be ""al dente"", but our food wasn't al dente at all. I know we probably should have said something to the server but given that the food took so long in the first place and the restaurant was closing soon, we didn't wanna do that.
3) my dish was EXTREMELY SALTY! Yes it was good, but the more I ate, I realized how salty it was - my mouth and my throat actually felt like they were burning and I drank multiple glasses of water (including when I got home)
4) both mine and my husband's stomachs started hurting when we arrived back home that night. Not sure if it's because the pasta dough wasn't cooked all the way or what, but we were in pain. Luckily we didn't have to vomit but it felt pretty close to it.
5) I checked in to restaurant so we received a free tiramisu slice, which was cool - but it was a really small slice! I don't think I've been served this small of a slice before anywhere; and the price for this is $8 according to the menu, so for that price, I don't think it's worth it.
6) the price for what we ate drank didn't seem to be worth it in my opinion - we paid about $80, for two glasses of wine and two entrees (which includes tax and tip).
Our highlight of the night was actually the bread we received - focaccia bread with balsamic vinegar, olive oil and parsley (could have used more of this mix though because we ended up with more bread!). It was delicious!
I'm disappointed in our experience as most previous reviews were very positive, and probably won't be back.","Vandira S.","90o90 po o po ok ok ioo ok o oilso 99o9 i.p.o i.p.o i9 ok i 9i 9 koi 9i OPoiou OP iiiiiooonn oppo i","Daniel B.","First, the only reason for the four-star rating was the price. I had a ""32 ounce Tomahawk Ribeye"" with a price of $129. Now, I would have happily paid that had there been more than 16 ounces of meat, but there was so much fat that I got maybe 8-10 ounces. This was a disappointment.
That said, the rest of the meal was great. The food was cooked superbly and the wine selection was so diverse that anything on he menu could be paired accordingly.
The server (young man with a beard and a great personality-reminiscent of Seth Rogen) was excellent! He was not short on knowledge (except for being able to explain the difference between ice cream and gellato).
Tucked into a residential strip mall, the outside of the restaurant leaves much to be desired. However, the decor inside paints a picture of a typical New York Italian bistro, transplanted in the Pacific Northwest.
I had the Tiramisu for dessert while my friend had the flourless chocolate-walnut cake. Both were home-runs! Hat's off to the chef that made these!
I'd come back, with the goal of trying their lobster ravioli.
My suggestion to the owner is to re-evaluate some (not all) prices, such as the Tomahawk, and your rating will increase.
Lastly, my compliments to the chefs. They got their acts together!","Astacia C.","This place should be called ""Pink Sauce"" as the stuff is on everything! Which is disappointing because it's bland. I can't say more because it was so forgettable","Van T.","This place is literally a hidden gem. I randomly found it here on yelp, saw a picture of the tomahawk steak and had to try it. When we got to the restaurant, it was in such a weird spot but I'm glad we decided to give it a go anyways! We went for dinner on a Friday night. It wasn't too busy, our waitress was great and very informative. The food was absolutely amazing! We got the tomahawk steak ( obviously) it came with a side of pasta which was sooooo good and creamy! We also had the seafood spaghetti which I forgot the name but that was also so good!!! Definitely Recommend!","Susie D.","I was so disappointed by this restaurant. It was recommended by a friend and seeing the reviews I really thought it would be good. Apparently there is new ownership and it must be dramatically different than before because this is waaaaayyy over priced for what you get.
First off they didn't have any of the wine bottles that were listed in the menu. The waiter had to search all over for each one we asked for. He instead came back with an $80 bottle Syrah (that was marked up by $50). The waiter told us he would get us a deal on the wine but never did so. And he kept topping off our wine, who does that??
The service was fine, but the food was so mediocre. Way too much vinegar in the salad dressing, the bruschetta was bland. Our main courses were just odd. They were served on scalding hot plates so that the sauce on my pork chop was boiling. My husband had the most flavorless filet mignon. It was just such a disappointment. In the end we couldn't believe that we paid almost $200 for it all.","Stash P.","Great authentic Italian dinner and hands down the best in WA. Whether you're on a date, your family or a group, you will not be disappointed.","Wen W.","I've been in Burien for about 8 years, and I can't believe I let this little tucked-away restaurant get away from my sight all these times! Bistro Baffi is what you would consider a little local authentic Italian restaurant with intimate and romantic vibe if you ever want to have a peaceful evening out in Burien and want to avoid the city hassle.
When we first came in, the head chef waved at us to say hi. That is what I loved: The friendly and intimate vibe you'd get from a small local restaurant. We were seated right away despite with our reservation. I think it was a Friday night, so the restaurant wasn't crazily busy just yet. There was candle lit for our table, so that was neat. We didn't order drinks and heavy appetizer. We simply started out with salad and went straight for seafood and pasta for entrees. The food was excellent with fresh wild-caught prawns and scallops. The pasta dishes were served with light creamy sauce, so that went easy in my stomach since I don't do well with dairy products.
The waitress knew what she was doing when presenting to us the specials of the day. It was like she memorized the speech at the back of her head, or it's just that she really enjoyed talking about the fresh seafood of the day. Either way, I'd take that over listening to a waitress who would stumble and not know what to say about a product.
We will definitely come back to this restaurant!","John S.","Amazing real old-school Italian preparations, not the usual Italian-American fare or Italian-inspired fusion. The owner and the cooks know their stuff, they do it right, and they take great pride in their work. We finished with a very fine Barros 20-year port","Robert I.","Met the owner and chef, very nice folks. Lobster risotto was really good, salmon risotto was less so. Waitress was fairly inattentive and a bit spacey.","Peter N.","My brother and I had some strong cravings for Italian, so we decided to pull into this restaurant for dinner.
As soon as we entered the front doors, we could see the chefs whipping meals together right behind the front counter - I thought that was kinda neat. We were seated immediately and served water along with the menus.
I ordered the Alfredo Peppardelle and my brother got the Lamb-chops. When our food arrived, I thought the portion sizes were decent. The first bite made me grin from ear to ear! It was creamy and full of flavor. I loved it! I hate to admit this, but halfway through my meal, I was getting a bit tired of the flavor. It's not a flavor I can constantly eat for an entire meal.
Prices were also on the higher end. The two orders came out to about $80 for the both of us. That would have to be the biggest downfall for me since I know there are so many other options out there that come at a more reasonable price.","Jillian E.","Rich, delicious and will definitely be back! Having been my first visit, next time, and my recommendation, I think ordering dishes the table is interested in and taking bites of each would be best. The dishes we had were so good! Started with the focaccia bread (baked in house) of course with the clams Rockefeller (Rich, creamy and cheesy). For our entrees we have the pappardelle with mushroom/ truffle (so rich and sooo good, but hard to finish), the penne alla mike (lighter/spicy pink sauce with shrimp), and the lobster ravioli (richer pink sauce with great bites of lobster and veggies inside). We don't frequent Burien often but now have a new reason to return. The staff (Carmen) were fabulously friendly including the chef who greeted us upon arrival. The atmosphere is quaint and romantic.","KT M.","Love this place. I've only met one of the owners but he was very friendly and welcoming. I've been here about 5 times and it's my favorite place when I want Italian. Penne ala Mike is delish!!!","Nancy W.","I'm sorry you feel this way because much of what you're saying is inaccurate. I called and talked to the manager once. It was an uphill battle the whole conversation and never once did he agree to take responsibility for mistakes that were made. He indicated he would contact me with a resolution and that never happened. I never asked for free food for two persons. I was the one whose dish was incorrect and you made it again and also gave me a portion to take home. What I took home was still not correct. It was my mistake in saying that the freshwater prawns were lobsters. That said, it doesn't take away the fact that one of them was half again the size as the other and if you have two people sitting next to one another ordering the same dish, it's rather awkward. Also, I didn't have a special request with my pasta dish, rather I substituted the penne with linguine because I don't care for thick pasta. It shouldn't have affected how you made the dish. Lastly, I never asked you to have Michael stay or run the business. I simply stated that when he ""was"" running the business it was much more hands on, he cared more about the quality of food, the presentation and would actually come out and talk to the customers at their table. I maintain my review and I'm only sorry that you cannot be accurate about yours...","Matt R.","Had heard great things about this place but it was just ok. Everything seems to come with a tomato cream sauce which is not very memorable. Saltimbocca sauce was watery, ravioli was not bad. Risotto was no true risotto as it was made with that pink tomato cream. Authentic risotto does not have a sauce, the creaminess should come from stirring the rice while it cooks. Caprese salad had hard ice cold tomatoes. Would have been better if they were room temp. Definitely not authentic Italian but had good service in a nice atmosphere. Probably won't go back.","Gina T.","WOW. Just wow! This place is beyond expectation. Delicious and the atmosphere is beautiful. Elegant. Tried the traditional spaghetti and meatballs. Very good. Excellent and well prepared. Came for dinner. Next I had to try the tiramisu. Yummy! Very nice evening.","Kathleen D.","We had such a good dinner at Bistro Baffi a couple of nights ago! We went with a couple of friends, one from Canada (Victoria) and the other from Renton. None of us had been to the restaurant before.
Our server (I think her name was Rachel) was wonderful and made some great suggestions, since we were ""newbies"". We loved the stuffed mushroom appetizers, and the bruschetta was phenomenal! The bread was perfectly grilled and was not at all crunchy and hard. The tomato, mozzarella, and prosciutto topping was perfect. (The prosciutto was not on the menu, but Rachel said they were offering it that night as a special.)
We had the Ravioli D'Aragosta, Spaghetti Pescatore, and a Scallops dish for our main courses. Wonderful!
We had no room for dessert, but that didn't keep a couple of us from sharing the fabulous tiramisu - the best I have ever had.
We all agreed that we will be returning to Bistro Baffi again.","Allison L.","Recently, was in Burien on business and selected this charming restaurant since they took reservation and we were a large party. They had a dinning room that was perfect for our dinner. The service was gracious and personal.
Even better was the freshness of the fish - they bring table side the fresh fish of the day and tell you how it is prepared. Many of us had the Pasta di' Mare - which was delicious. Hard to imagine but we finished with some desserts - the limoncello sorbet was perfect!
It would be a favorite neighborhood gem if I lived nearby!"
